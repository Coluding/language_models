We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term, volatility and forfeiture rate related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis and will incorporate these factors into our option-pricing model. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant management judgment. If, in the future, we determine that another method for calculating the fair value of our stock options is more reasonable, or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance, and, therefore, should be used to estimate expected volatility or expected term, the fair value calculated for our employee stock options could change significantly.

Stimulation and Well Intervention Services Hydraulic Fracturing . Our customers utilize our hydraulic fracturing services to enhance the production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability, which restricts the natural flow of hydrocarbons. Hydraulic fracturing involves pumping a fluid down a well casing or tubing at sufficient pressure to cause the underground producing formation to crack, allowing the oil or natural gas to flow more freely. A propping agent, or proppant, is suspended in the fracturing fluid and pumped into the cracks (fractures) created by the fracturing process in the underground formation to prop the fractures open. Proppants generally consist of sand, bauxite, resin-coated sand or ceramic particles and other engineered proprietary materials. The extremely high pressure required to stimulate wells in the regions in which we operate presents a challenging environment for achieving a successfully fractured horizontal well. As a result, an important element of the services we provide to producers is designing the optimum well completion, which includes determining the proper fluid, proppant and injection specifications to maximize production.',)\n",

Hydraulic fracturing involves pumping a fluid down a well casing or tubing at sufficient pressure to cause the underground producing formation to fracture, allowing the oil or natural gas to flow more freely. A propping agent, or proppant, is suspended in the fracturing fluid and used to prop the fractures open.

Pricing, however, remained relatively flat, in part due to the continued level of competition in the market. -55- At the end of 2014 we saw a pullback in drilling and completion activities in response to commodity price declines and the slowdown has intensified in 2015. We are currently experiencing a decrease in activity across our customer base, which in turn has increased competition and put pressure on pricing for our services.',)\n",

Our engineering staff also provides technical evaluation, job design and fluid recommendations for our customers as an integral element of our fracturing service. Our operating strategy for this service line includes maintaining high asset utilization levels to maximize revenue generation. To implement this strategy, we have focused on those markets historically requiring significant pumping services, substantial hydraulic horsepower (HHP) capacity, and large volumes of consumables. Our hydraulic fracturing assets are concentrated in operating areas characterized by complex, technically demanding, service intensive work with higher HHP requirements.

      "('The oil and gas industry has traditionally been volatile, is highly sensitive to supply and demand cycles and is influenced by a combination of long-term and cyclical trends, including the current and expected future prices for oil and gas, and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices, as well as production depletion rates and the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by exploration and production companies to their drilling and workover budgets. There is increasing horizontal drilling and completion related activity in oily- and liquids-rich formations due to the significant disparity between oil and natural gas prices on a Btu basis. Further, based on industry data, we believe the price disparity will continue over the near-to-medium term resulting in increasing demand for the types of services that we offer in the unconventional formations with oily- and liquids-rich content. The development of unconventional drilling environments requires more complex, technically demanding completion jobs than conventional drilling activity. Despite this increase in demand, pricing has nonetheless declined in some areas with the migration of drilling and completion capacity from the gassier regions, particularly for hydraulic fracturing where current capacity exceeds demand.',)\n",
      "('Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans, there is a significant degree of judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a long-lived asset over its estimated remaining useful life.

The Company determined the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are independent of other asset groups to be at the service line level, which consists of the hydraulic fracturing, coiled tubing, wireline, pumpdown, directional drilling and international coiled tubing service lines. It was concluded that the sharp fall in commodity prices during the second half of 2014 constituted a triggering event due to the potential for a slowdown in activity across the Companys customer base, which in turn would increase competition and put pressure on pricing for its services. Although the severity and extent of this downturn is uncertain, absent a significant recovery in commodity prices, activity and pricing levels may decline in future periods.',)\n",
      "('The sustained price disparity between oil and natural gas on a Btu basis led to the migration of equipment from basins that are predominantly gas-related, and much of the current horizontal drilling and completion related activity is concentrated in oily- and liquids-rich formations. Commodity prices will likely continue to hamper drilling activities in natural gas shale plays over the near term. The excess completion capacity into the oily- and liquids-rich regions and weakness in the price of natural gas has led to increased competition among energy service companies in the oily regions and negatively affected the spot market pricing for our services. Although, we do not expect the current environment to significantly improve without an increase in rig count, we are confident in our ability to successfully compete in and manage through the challenges. Entering the fourth quarter of 2013 we saw an increase in activity across our core service lines.

Oil and natural gas prices, and therefore the level of drilling, completion and workover activity by our customers, historically have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be highly volatile. For example, within the past year, oil prices were as high as $107 per barrel and have been as low as $44 per barrel. Generally, as the supply of these commodities decreases and demand increases, service and maintenance requirements increase as oil and natural gas producers attempt to maximize the productivity of their wells in a higher priced environment.

If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss.

Then, the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying value.

Impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level of our businesses, consistent with the presentation of our operating segments. Before employing detailed impairment testing methodologies, we may first evaluate the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors relevant to each reporting unit, such as macroeconomic, industry, market or any other factors that have a significant bearing on fair value. If we first utilize a qualitative approach and determine that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, we then apply detailed testing methodologies. Otherwise, we conclude that no impairment has occurred. We may also choose to bypass a qualitative approach and opt instead to employ detailed testing methodologies, regardless of a possible more likely than not outcome. Our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit.',)\n",

For example, natural gas prices declined sharply in 2009 and remained depressed through 2014, which resulted in reduced drilling activity in natural gas shale plays. This drove many energy services companies operating in those areas to relocate their equipment to more oily- and liquids-rich shale plays, such as the Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin. As drilling activity and completion capacity migrated into the oily- and liquids-rich regions from the gas-rich regions, the increase in supply relative to demand negatively impacted pricing and utilization of our services, particularly for hydraulic fracturing services.

      "('When these capital investments decline, our customers demand for our services declines. Because these types of services can be easily started and stopped, and oil and natural gas producers generally tend to be less risk tolerant when commodity prices are low or volatile, we typically experience a more rapid decline in demand for our services compared with demand for other types of energy services. While higher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers, sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth, and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers. Any negative impact on the spending patterns of our customers may cause lower pricing and utilization for our core service lines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Spending by exploration and production companies can also be impacted by conditions in the capital markets. Limitations on the availability of capital, or higher costs of capital, for financing expenditures may cause exploration and production companies to make additional reductions to capital budgets in the future even if oil prices remain at current levels or natural gas prices increase from current levels.',)\n",

And outside China, small molecule was up sequentially in the quarter. Chemicals and advanced materials declined 11% versus growth of 27% last year, while flat sequentially. Our chemicals and energy subsegments were down 15% while advanced materials were down roughly 2% globally and up 4% in the Americas and Europe combined. The food market was down low double digits against a tough 20% growth comparison last year. High single digit growth in the Americas was offset by declines in all other regions. In the Americas, PFAS testing is emerging as an important growth area in food testing, helping drive the high single digit growth. We expect testing for PFAS chemicals will continue to be a growth driver across multiple end markets over time. The environmental and forensics market declined 3% versus 18% growth last year. Similar to the food market, the Americas region continues to experience strong growth, up double digits driven by PFAS.',)\n",

I think we don't talk about weather but I think the more favorable weather environment in Europe actually has put less pressure on customers relative to energy cost and energy demand. So that's been net positive but we're still keeping an eye on things. Okay. And then could you just discuss your margin outlook and then pacing across '23? What's kind of -- and then further ahead, kind of what's the level of expansion potential going forward? How much gas is left in the tank there, looking out in the out years? You want to take that, Bob? Yes. I still have gas in the tank, yes. I mean I think, obviously, despite the inflationary environment that we're in, we're still able to manage growing our margins.\",)\n",

And in times of tough economic times, the market times, the productivity help and driving productivity in the labs as a well-received offering we have. Matt, just one other quick thing on that. One of the great things that Angelica and team have been doing and you heard us talk about this a lot is about the increasing of the attach rate and that continues to grow at roughly 1 point again year-on-year this year. And that kind of locks in that resiliency of that stability in that business. And if you think about a 2/3 of that business growing double digits, it really helped power the business and when we see the inevitable turnaround of the instrument business, that will be a nice tailwind as well. So, absolutely, Bob. Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. So the chemical and advanced materials business, we actually performed a little better than we were expecting. Obviously, you're still seeing some headwinds in the chemical side.\",)\n",

Sarah, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Brandon. Mike, it would be helpful if you kind of unpack what you're seeing in terms of instrument demand between, let's say, mid to large pharma relative to smaller biotech.\",)\n",
      "(\"And then last quarter, you noted that you'd worked on the backlog on the instrument portfolio, but for the total business, orders can grew faster than revenues. So can you kind of give us some of that context as well in terms of order book and backlog trends between instruments versus the rest of the business as well? Rachel, thanks for the question. As you know, we don't report on book-to-bill, but what we can use is how to qualitatively describe the backlog and I think we used the word normalized backlog from the elevated levels we have seen in the quarter. So we're at a normal level of backlog in terms of month supply. So -- and we've been talking about this movement towards normalization in terms of the backlog, and we're there now. Yes. And Rachel, you're right. Our orders grew greater than revenue in Q1. And as I mentioned earlier in the call, Q2, it reversed where revenue was greater than orders. And we did eat into backlog both in Q1 and Q2 in the instrument side and supply. As to the delivery times declined, we thought that that was a healthy thing.\",)\n",
      "(\"Our major customers here are really conservative in terms of their deployment of capital. Many of our largest customers are on cost control. So that's been -- that's what you're seeing reflected in the numbers, and that's why we expect a constrained outlook on that side of the business for a while. The different story on the Advanced Materials, and I think Bob, you pointed to good growth geographically globally outside of China. And then Phil, I know you and the team got a whole bunch of initiatives around the applied markets, particularly not only PFAS but Advanced Materials. And I thought a good opportunity for me to introduce you to the audience and have you share your perspective on what we're doing on the applied on the Advanced Materials side. Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes, certainly, we've mentioned you've talked around the activity within labs being ex-China, at least being reasonably robust. But on the applied market side and certainly around Advanced Materials. We're certainly relatively strong in those markets, and we're seeing good really good generation around the batteries market. And of course, we've spoken about the onshoring process around there in the Advanced Materials area.\",)\n",
      "(\"But I think in terms of the quarter, Bob, I think we came in right about where we thought we'd be in CAM and I'd say it's a mixed story in terms of different segments growing at different rates. Yes. Before Jacob, maybe you can jump in. I think the one thing that I think is important is you really have story in China, which is its own and then the rest of the business. And so if you think about where Americas and Europe is, it's performed extremely well. And if you actually look - we mentioned this in the call, sequentially, the dollars actually were very stable. And so we are expecting a challenging Q4, mainly because we grew 70% in China. 43% in Q3. Yes. So it's a compare situation. But this business continues to be very strong. Do you want to make the comments on the Advanced Materials side of the house there, Jacob? Yes, I can say that.\",)\n",
      "(\"And then I didn't - hear anybody asked about the ACG margin, maybe they did I missed it, but you guys had a material step-up there, can you talk about really what went on there, is that - is there any benefit that you saw from Mike lack of incentive comp just kind of break-out, where the drivers there and really how we should think about that in Q4, and as a jump-off point? Yes, we did mention that there was a benefit, Luke, of the variable pay comp, obviously, that's got a big component of people in it, but it's also a reflection of the scale and - continued growth of that business. We didn't say take that 32% I believe it was in Q3 and kind of book that as the new starting point. Because it had outsized growth. But we continue to be pleased and expect continued margin expansion for ACG going-forward. All right, great. Thank you.\",)\n",
      "(\"So I tried to make that come out in the script. But our plans to continue to invest for the future long-term growth this business remains high. We're going full steam ahead on the capital expansion and they're tracking according to plan. In fact, I think we'll probably do a little bit better on the cost side when all said and done relative to the CapEx that's involved. And Bob, maybe you can talk a little bit about some of the things we're seeing relative -- I think we commented on this before, but what have we seen in the marketplace relative to 2024 relative to NASD. Yes. I think, Matt, it's a great question. And so if we look at the details of kind of the mix, actually, I would say we have the most healthy mix of portfolio in NASD and '24 than we've had. So a significant increase in the number of programs that we are going to have been going through. Now it's a bigger component of clinical volume versus commercial volume, which I actually think bodes very well for the future going forward.\",)\n",
      "('Before turning it over to Bob for more details, I want to provide some high-level perspective on FY24 and beyond. For 2024, we anticipate a slow, but steady recovery, throughout the year. In our initial outlook, at the high end of our guidance we expect revenues to return to growth. At the same time, our range for EPS in the year ahead has us again delivering leveraged EPS growth. As we look ahead, we remain convinced the market challenges being faced by the industry today are transient. Our end markets are powered by investments in improving the human condition. The pace of science, innovation and discovery continues to increase, which will fuel further growth. We remain focused on winning in the marketplace. Our differentiated products, services and most importantly our One Agilent team, are all essential to the success of our customers. We are well-positioned for long-term growth. Bob will now share more detail on the quarter and the year, along with more specifics on our initial view for fiscal 2024 and Q1. Thank you for joining us today. And now, Bob, over to you. Thanks Mike, and good afternoon, everyone.',)\n",
      "(\"Operating margin in the quarter are 27.1%, up 80 basis points. Earnings per share of $1.37 were up 13%. Let's now take a closer look at our first quarter performance, starting with end market highlights. Chemicals and Advanced materials led the way for us with another outstanding quarter, delivering 14% core growth with strength across all geographies. The strength in our pharma business continues and is up 11%, with both large and small molecule growing nicely. This is on top of 17% growth last year. Our environmental friend business grew 12%, while the academia government and the food markets both grew 8%. On a geographic basis, China once again led the way. Our China team continued their record of strong execution overcoming any disruption associated with COVID and delivered 13% growth during the quarter, exceeding our expectations. In Europe, we also delivered stronger-than-expected results, growing 10%. The Americas shows a solid results with 8% growth. Looking at our performance by business unit. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered revenues of $1.03 billion, up 11% core. LSAG delivered growth across all end markets and regions.\",)\n",
      "(\"And I think the -- and Padraig, correct me if I'm wrong, I think the overall sentiment is economic uncertainty and just being cautious. It's a -- it's like I said earlier, it's a hard one to initially figure out because there's no obvious external catalysts because we deal with this. But -- this is what we're seeing, and we just thought it was important to share that directly on the call today. Yes. I think, Josh, the one thing that we did see, and we talked about this at the beginning of the year because there was a lot of talk about the stimulus. That stimulus was targeted at higher-end applications and instrumentation that we don't necessarily have the product portfolio or compete in. And so I don't think that has moved budgets, but it created a stimulus for potentially areas that we're not as exposed to as maybe some other players in the marketplace. Okay. I appreciate all the detail. You're quite welcome. Your final question comes from the line of Liza Garcia with UBS. Please go ahead. Thanks for squeezing me in. Really appreciate it.\",)\n",
      "(\"And as Bob mentioned in his comments, I think July, we actually saw the weakest performance within the quarter, and we're still seeing weakness in the pharmaceutical industry, for example, the level of manufacturing declined pretty specifically in the month of July. So we think the market is going to be there, but it's going to take a while for it to get back to growth. And I guess probably the other thing to point here is - and again, I'm talking specifically around the instrument side of the China market. As you know, we have a very large, in fact, the largest installed base of instrumentation in the marketplace. So very positive on the ability to grow the aftermarket in our diagnostics business. Probably anything you add to that? Okay. Maybe just for my follow-up, just on ACG. So a good quarter in that business. And I know you guys talked about a year or two ago about sort of a goal of 30% plus margins obviously achieved this quarter.\",)\n",
      "(\"So we've got a pretty rigorous program. And what I can assure you is that we will make the reductions in areas that we don't think will get in the way of our ability to continue to sustain what we believe to be out market growth. And Bob, I know you put a lot of thought and time on this, but we've already been activating a lot of the software already. So we didn't wait to the earnings call to get started on this, but I know that we think there's a path forward here for us. Yes. Just to build on what Mike is saying. Obviously, we've got -- we've been looking at discretionary spend, things like travel but also demand related. If there's not demand, we're not going to spend the same level of marketing funds as an example. And we continue to really drive productivity. We talked about that at the very beginning of the year around productivity in our workforce, and we'll continue to do that, making sure that we don't get ahead of ourselves in terms of adding more people relative to the business. Understood. Thank you, guys. Sure.\",)\n",
      "(\"We have been -- we've seen a lot of growth last year, and we continue to see it. Obviously, right now, since there's also a lot of funding through the government, it's a little bit lumpy. But if you look at for the long horizon, this is a huge opportunity for us, and we have a very strong position with our LCMS business here. And we're also seeing it expanding into new areas with the DCMS business. So I'm still very bullish on that, and we continue to see a lot of business here. And Jack, I think it's also fair to say it's primarily a U.S. and a little bit European phenomena. We've got to see really new ranks being deployed and implemented in China and Japan, which down the road could be a source of continued growth on a global basis. Yes, you're absolutely right, Mike. I mean there's a lot of things going on here in U.S., and there's been regulation in certain states right now, but it's driven by regulation. So when regulations go onboard and online in different countries, you see a step-up in that. So there's definitely more to come here. Got it.\",)\n",
      "(\"So our stated investment plans remain unchanged. Yes, to be very clear, Luke, to add what Mike said, we are not slowing that down at all. That investment is one of the highest priorities, we've trimmed back spending in another less more infrastructure kind of oriented projects as opposed to kind of revenue-generating. I think what you're seeing actually is it's actually coming in better-than-expected, because the pricing is better-than-expected and you probably have seen that in other places. And so, the availability of parts and the key materials is better than what we had initially planned as well. Yes, I only add to what you guys said that Mike along with having more customers and actually more diversified set of customers, we're going to be we're contracted to do more programs next year than in the history of NASD. So it's a yes, all full-speed ahead. Got you. Got you.\",)\n",
      "(\"And then maybe just on ACG which had a good quarter. You talked about the contract revenue and specifically enterprise services. With that growth, maybe could you just help kind of size that contract business within ACG? And then maybe talk about what is driving that growth? And what kind of contribution can that make to the ACG segment over the course of this year? Matt, thanks for your support of the ACG business over the years. And I want to use this opportunity to introduce our new ACG Group President. But first, I'd like to maybe have a two-part response probably and Bob, I think it's roughly about 65% just to make sure. So roughly about 65% of our total services business is in the contracts arena. And Angelica, maybe you could share your thoughts on really what's been driving the growth we're seeing in that contract business. Yes. Thanks, Mike. As you mentioned, it's about 65% of the total business. And a part of that demand has really been driven by the lab-wide enterprise services offerings, where we're able to help customers as they're navigating their own economic situation really helping them optimize their entire lab operation.\",)\n",
      "(\"We saw broad resilience in the advanced materials with sequential growth. And given the extremely tough compare and high 20s we had last year, it was truly a very impressive result from the teams. The chemical and energy side was -- we saw a decline but on a very tough compare of 10% but we did see a sequential improvement versus Q4 '23. Overall, I think our portfolio is extremely strong in this area. We have ability to cross and upsell across that. And of course, our strong services offerings have that value proposition. And then, Bob, in terms of the guide for the year, I mean, you're sticking with the organic growth range for the year, you beat the first quarter. This China pull forward, then explain all of the upside in the first quarter what the NASD outlook is lower, what other moving parts by end market or geography kind of gets you to the same midpoint? Yes. That's a great question, Brandon. And you talked about a couple of them. We feel really good about where we started the year. It's still at the beginning of the year, though, so we're kind of banking some of that.\",)\n",
      "(\"By the way, one thing I'd add to that before Bob's, the specifics, Jack, is our decision on the Resolution Bioscience business so as part of the story for us next year in terms of margin expansion. So Bob? Yes. I would say that our view of leveraged earnings growth continues into '24. And so while we do have some things coming back to us, some of the actions that we've taken will continue to move into a full year for 2024. And quite honestly, that's kind of what we expect our job to be is to be able to drive that leveraged earnings growth. Thank you, guys. Welcome. Thank you. We go next now to Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Good job on the margin execution here, Mike. Mike, maybe I missed some of the comments here. Can you talk about the phasing in the quarter here in China? I think I heard when you start off down mid-singles and was July off like minus 25%, minus 30%, is that the exit rate? Yes. We take a change within the quarter. Yes, Vijay, this is Bob. Your math is in the ballpark.\",)\n",
      "(\"We saw no trends like the China trend in our other geographies. That's helpful, Mike. And Mike, maybe one that you mentioned a couple of times on transitory. I think that's a new firm that you're using -- what have you heard -  I think I move away from prudent to transitory. Yes. What have you guys heard on the ground on China stimulus, maybe some positive commentary, but nothing is concrete and why use the word transitory is the implication here fiscal '24 should be a more normalized year when we look at the comps? Yes. So, a couple of thoughts here, I think relative to the China business, we're hearing similar things, but nothing really significant and there's not enough to go onto assume we have kind of material impact on our outlook for the rest of the year. When we talk about transitory, we talked about the fact that these markets are driven by investments to improve the human condition as I mentioned. They're not going to go away.\",)\n",
      "(\"Yes. So we were down mid-single digits through June. So May and June kind of tracking as we expected, and then we saw incremental weakness in July, and we ended up for the full quarter down 17%. And what we're assuming going into Q4 is that, that performance will continue into Q4. And given the tough comp that we have because I think we grew 44% in Q4 of last year, we're estimating roughly a 35-ish percent drop in Q4 in China. Sorry. That's helpful, Bob. And just -- sorry, where I was going with that question was, can you talk about capital versus recurring? And I think when I look at your Americas in Europe, America is just flattish. Do you see a similar sort of phasing in ex-China, maybe talk about exit rates in July? So actually, if you think about the ACG business, actually ACG grew in all regions and all end markets, inclusive of China. So there wasn't a change there. And I would say both in the Americas and Europe, we didn't see that same effect. Yes. And overall, outside of China, the geographic performance was better than expected. Correct.\",)\n",
      "(\"Or any China impact, anything that can explain here at the sequential guide for 2Q? Yes. I'll pass this over to Bob for additional detail but I think the answer is no, not the unusual about movements between the quarters. And Bob, I think what we're going to do is we want to set up another guide in Q2 that was above our full year guide. So that was the process there. That's exactly right. I mean, I think as we look at this, we just came off a 10%, still 6% to 7.5% is still significantly above where we're forecasting the full year and I think we feel good and I think it's consistent with how we have guided in the past. I have missed we're very prudent yet today, Bob? I was waiting for that, Mike. So have to say the second quarter is a prudent guide. Is that a fair comment? That is correct. Fantastic. And then I did have one on this NASD, Mike -- at Novartis. I think they're pulling their API manufacturing in-house. And I know you're starting to train to see maybe provide some context and how big is Novartis as a customer?\",)\n",
      "(\"Just on ACG, just given if we do have this sort of 12- to 18-month cycle, you've talked in the past about the ability for ACG on the services side, whether it's extended warranties or others in terms of kind of helping to offset some of the weakness you might see in sort of capital equipment purchases by extending those services or increasing the services revenues. I realize it's a smaller portion of revenue relative to LSAG. But I'm just wondering if this is sort of a 12- to 18-month cycle, could you see some level of acceleration or at least durable sort of low double, high single-digit growth in ACG over the course of that time period? Yes. Look, I think the breadth of product offerings across many of the hardware platforms enables us to add all types of customer -- all types of customer operations. And what we're seeing is extremely strong demand for our services as utilization of the installed base happens. And in particular, we're seeing lab-wide enterprise service offerings, a big demand for that where we're helping customers with their efficiency, their asset management and so on.\",)\n",
      "(\"One, we are now on contract with more major pharma than we ever have been. And it's very promising. If you look at publicly the percentage of their overall R&D budgets that they're now spending on therapeutic oligos, and we are in the driver's seat to win those opportunities. And just in the last couple of weeks alone, I've spoken with a number of our lead pharma partners, and they've reaffirmed. So there is a slight navigation through the IRA, as Bob mentioned, the conviction on their end of the market potential remains unchanged and in the leadership position to pursue that. Got it. That's a great amount of detail. Maybe just, Bob, for you, just on pricing. Kind of what's embedded for next year as you think about pricing? And how has pricing kind of trended over the course of this year? Are we back to sort of normalized levels of pricing that you guys have historically achieved? Or is there still some pricing gains to see sort of as we move into next year in certain areas of your business? Yes. Matt, that's a great question.\",)\n",
      "(\"So we have spent a lot of energy of putting a high-quality solutions out there and we continue to see a lot of opportunities and we will continue to invest in this space beyond PFAS. I think environmental is really a place that there will be a lot of investment going in over the next decade. So really excited about that area also besides the Advanced Materials. And we'll go next now to Jack Meehan at Nephron Research. Wanted to spend a little time on DGG. Maybe start with the pathology business. So double-digit growth was stronger than, I guess, what we've seen in the last few quarters. Was there anything you noticed in terms of the uptick in the quarter? Yes. Jack, I'm going to actually pass that over to Sam because Sam actually is calling in from Denmark. He's actually with the pathology team right now. So you can get it latest and greatest on the ground from Glostrup. Go ahead, Sam. Yes. Thanks, Mike. Jack, thanks for the question. I'd offer you a couple of things that we've observed in the quarter and I think are also promising going forward.\",)\n",
      "('These reductions, while difficult, are necessary to ensure we continue to fund our most critical investments as well as fund the variable compensation resets from this year. These actions help ensure the company delivers leveraged earnings growth in FY24 and will enable us to emerge even stronger when our markets inevitably return to their long-term growth rates. As Mike noted earlier, we exited Q4 with some potential signs of stabilization with a book to bill ratio of 1 for the company and greater than 1 for LSAG instruments. While this is positive, we are going to be prudent in our initial guidance. For the full year guide, we expect revenue in the range of $6.71 billion to $6.81 billion. This represents a core growth range from a slight decline of 0.5% at the low end to 1 point of growth at the high end. Currency is a headwind of 1.2 points while M&A is also a slight headwind of 10 basis points related to Resolution Bioscience. On a reported basis, we are expecting a decline in the range of 1.8% to 0.3% year-on-year. From a geographic perspective, we expect modest growth in the Americas and Europe.',)\n",
      "(\"Can you talk through what you saw outside of China on the consumables side? Our consumables business was pretty consistent across the globe in terms of growth. So I don't know if you have anything you want to add to that on the -- or we've seen the consumables, I think we're really pleased to see that because it really speaks to the lab activity being robust. So anything else you want to jump in on with? Yes. Probably just one item there, Mike. I think we are seeing really good traction around our workflow development. So end-to-end solutions which obviously is also drives our services business as well. But around the consumables, the -- in most of our end markets, we've been pretty heavily focused on developing workflows and making our customers' lives easier and more integrated in our labs and that's showing some really good traction and that's reflected in solid connected attach rates in the consumable space. Thanks, Phil. I'm really glad you close with the comments about connect rates.\",)\n",
      "(\"Although this level of cautiousness -- the increased level of cautiousness we're seeing is really across all end market segments, but really centered in pharma. Yes. That's helpful, Mike. And just one quick one. This back half EPS and margins up, I think 2Q operating margins missed and just rough math here suggests back half operating margins need to be up 300 basis points from 2Q levels. With revenues coming down, can you just walk us through what gets us to that? What drives that margin expansion? Yes, you're right. In Q2, we did -- we had higher revenues than expected. And we did have some negative mix effect that resulted in a lower-than-expected margin. Now we did expand. We just didn't expand as much as we had anticipated. And as a result of the lower guidance, as Mike talked about doubling down on cost efficiencies, so we've taken a number of actions to streamline our spending profile in the second half of the year in order to drive greater margin expansion in the second half to drive the EPS.\",)\n",
      "(\"And we also looked at our recent analysis and concluded that even with more additional investment, this is going to be a business that's going to be undergoing significant losses for some foreseeable future, so. It was a difficult, as Mike said, that the right decision to make this move now. But again to be clear, we continue to serve cancer research and diagnostics in a number of ways. Yes. I think - Sam, when we've talked about this in the past. So, we think we're still going be able to participate in what we believe the strong growth of liquid biopsy market. But to really providing a lot of the - if you will, ingredients for the test developers for themselves. Here and Mike. I'm going to take this opportunity to also just to say beyond our core SureSelect Target Enrichment portfolio which is used broadly for liquid biopsy testing today. Early next year, we'll be launching solutions from Avida BioMed, an acquisition that we announced earlier this year, which we think is really going to be a differentiated way to look at methylation, as well as classic mutation analysis. Yes.\",)\n",
      "(\"But the impact of Lunar New Year was not only in Q1 but it's also been reflected in our Q2. It was roughly 0.5 point headwind in Q1 and that's come back to us in Q2. So it was kind of as planned. And in regards to the stimulus, the way we're looking at this is Sims got kicked off in the calendar Q4. There is a section in there that's focused on equipment for universities and hospitals. But from our perspective, it's still early. So we're kind of waiting right now to see how it plays out. And but I think at this point, we really haven't put anything assumed in our guide or China growth relative to the stimulus. So if it does get deployed and comes to our way, then that will be an upside to our current forecast. And I think Puneet, you said it well. I mean, our business in China continues to be very, very strong and I couldn't be prouder of the team, how they delivered in Q1 and that's continuing strong momentum throughout the second half of last year and we would expect that to continue here in Q2 as well.\",)\n",
      "(\"Given the large change in China, I wanted to provide some additional perspective on how we are forecasting the rest of the year, recognizing that the market continues to be very dynamic. To provide some context, in Q3 through June, our business in China was tracking to a mid-single-digit decline in revenue, which was in line with our expectations. However, in July, we saw a further deterioration in China, resulting in the 17% decline for the quarter. And while the Q3 decline in China was centered in pharma, which was down 30%, we did see weakness in the other end markets as well. We expect the conditions we've seen in July to persist in China for Q4. In addition, we are facing our most difficult quarterly compare in China, where we grew 44% in Q4 of last year. We are now expecting Q4 to decline in the mid-30s year-on-year. For the full year, we are expecting China to decline mid-single digits versus growing mid-single digits.\",)\n",
      "(\"As I mentioned, down roughly mid-30s and that really impacts a number of markets you can imagine, both AR and chemical and energy, which are - or chemical and advanced materials, which are the two largest markets in China. I would also say that the diagnostics and clinical is also down. We've seen that softness in genomics. And then obviously, the shutdown of Res Bio also impacts that business, and that's primarily a U.S. phenomenon. So we did see an impact in U.S. on that side. And then there's some puts and takes in other places, but those are the two big pieces for Q4. But as I recall, I think 85% of the change was really China driven and bleeds over into pharma in CAM. Got it. Okay. Then Mike, I guess, staying on China and a follow-up there. Can you unpack a bit more of what you're seeing by end market? I mean, like where demand is holding in versus like areas that you've seen come in lighter as the quarter progressed again. I guess, outside of China - sorry, outside of pharma. And then I guess, a follow-up on Dan's question. I believe it was earlier.\",)\n",
      "(\"Maybe just one on instruments, Bob, I think you talked earlier, I think to Derik's question maybe you gave the L segment, but I know there's consumables within that. Could you just break out what the instrument number is? I know we've got on the Q. Just wondering how instrument did and as we look ahead, I think given your instrument exposure, it's always a key question, I know there's been various times asked throughout, but just how would we think about kind of the outlook for instrument, whether it be fourth quarter, if you want to point to go out a little further? Yes. So to maybe add a little more flavor and clarity to my answer previously, LSAG was down 9% core. It was down 9% in instruments as well. So the consumables business was up basically a point. And as we look out there, I'm just wondering. I guess it's really depends upon that - the type of product, which you guys already discussed, it sounds like you're optimistic on LSAG given the funnel is going to get back towards that excuse me LCMS is going to get back to that 5% growth.\",)\n",
      "(\"So it was really pleased with the results. I know our narrative is different than others are saying but I also think my team in China capability is also different. Got it. And then on the NASD Train C, I guess, expansion. Can you just talk about time line for that build-out. And as I remember back to Train B, I think a good amount of that was already kind of earmarked for customer demand. In the same case this time around with the current expansion. Yes. I want to tag team a bit with this with Sam and myself and Bob. So we evenly refer to Train B. That's the latest expansion that's coming online this year. In fact, we had a chance to see that firsthand when we went to the groundbreaking ceremony for what we call Project endeavor or as you're referring to [indiscernible]; it looks really good. We're on track for that mid-calendar year go live and we have a full book of business for that just a matter of ramp. And again, project up.\",)\n",
      "(\"And we're assuming that this current performance will maintain through the second half of the year. We're not going to see a recovery. Got it. That's super helpful. And then if I could touch on the early-stage biotech customers. Can you just remind us for the overall company, I know you provided pharma. But for the overall company, what's the mix there? And then also, is there any impact that you saw -- expect there in the NASD business or your cell therapy offerings as a result of that? And just given the number of questions we're getting here, just at a high level, Mike, instrumentation, very strong over the last two years, one of the remarkable cycle of instrumentation placements that we have seen over the last few decades. When do you think we get back to sort of a normalized order pattern for instrumentation? So maybe we start with the biotech and NASD business questions first. So no impact at all in our NASD business. I think, Sam, we can say that pretty equivocally, right? And to give you a perspective, emerging biotech, Puneet, is roughly -- it's less than 5% of the total company.\",)\n",
      "(\"And what we're trying to do here is comment to you today is what we're seeing today in the marketplace, and it's a level of increased cautiousness on capital deployment. Vijay, maybe just to add a couple of other comments to what Mike was saying. In the second quarter, we talked about revenue exceeding our orders, and that was really at the -- towards the back end. And we came into Q2, we'd say, still greater than normal backlog. And so we were able to -- our OFS team was able to actually drive down our backlog and leverage that. And if you took the backlog impact out of our numbers, we would have been at mid-single digits for transparency in Q2. And we had built some of that into our forecast. We just didn't refill the funnel as much as we thought we were going to coming into Q2, which means resulted in a lower expectation for the second half of the year. That's extremely helpful, Bob and Mike. Sorry, go ahead, Mike. I was just going to say too, Bob, I think it's fair to say relative to our guide assumptions, we're mainly looking at the pharma market.\",)\n",
      "(\"And we ended the Q4 at just a little under 3% and actually for the full year was greater than that. So it actually continues to be hold up very well. What we're building into our plan for next year is roughly 2 percentage points of price, which, as you know, is greater than our historical kind of pre-COVID levels. And so what we've been able to do, I think, is -- really speaks to the value proposition that we have as well as the emerging mix of our businesses as well. We go next now to Rachel Vatnsdal at JPMorgan. So first off, I just want to ask on China. You mentioned that the region is down 30% this quarter. That was in line with your expectations. You're expecting it to decline mid-singles again next year. So I guess, just how much of a function is that really due to some of the comps and starting to lap the easier comp late into next year versus is there anything structurally wrong with that market? And how do you expect China to continue to grow on that medium to long term?\",)\n",
      "(\"I think Bob alluded to it a bit in his prepared remarks, but we still are staying with our balanced capital allocation strategy, and you saw us in the market opportunistically on share repurchases given where we saw the share price setting that. In terms of our - an appetite for M&A, it remains unchanged given - despite the Resolution Bioscience decision. We knew that was a higher risk acquisition for us, early-stage company in hot area based on a really differentiating strategy that didn't want this to play out. But we've had some success in other aspects of our genomics acquisitions, including the AAT acquisition on the instrumentation side. So we're still out there looking. But as Bob mentioned, we take a disciplined approach to not only to how we view our internal choices and our internal business performance in terms of what's in the portfolio, but we'll also take that same lens, if you will, on how we look at M&A. So really, nothing has changed beyond the fact that this is more of a buyer's market.\",)\n",
      "('Our pathology-related business performed well with double-digit growth led by the Americas and Europe. NASD posted another strong quarter, growing 22%. Our Train B manufacturing expansion remains on track to come online mid-calendar year. In January, we announced an additional $725 million expansion of our NASD facility that will double our oligo manufacturing capacity. And 2 weeks ago, we are pleased to have the Governor of Colorado join us in our groundbreaking ceremony at the Frederick site. In addition to organic investments, we continue to invest externally in new technologies and partnerships. In the quarter, we welcomed the Avida Biomed team into Agilent, further enhancing our genomics capabilities. Avida is early-stage life sciences company designed to assist clinical researchers using NGS approach in the study of cancer. We also continue to partner with new technology platform companies to drive our solutions in the marketplace. This quarter, we announced a partnership with the Akoya Biosciences to combine our companion diagnostic and IHC workload expertise with their solution to drive multiplex tissue assay development for biopharma. In addition to these business group highlights, Agilent was again recognized among the top 100 most just companies in the U.S. by Just Capital and CNBC.',)\n",
      "(\"And the trick here is to make sure you're doing the right thing to manage the business in the short run in terms of being able to deliver leveraged earnings growth for our shareholders, and that's why I talked about the confidence we have in our shareholder value creation model. But at the same point in time, make sure that we don't cut off things that are going to get in the way of our long-term growth. And we know how to do this. We've done this before. We've got some variable pay programs. We have things we look at relative to travel and other things that are associated with expense, things that aren't necessarily immediately near-term revenue generating. And then what we'll do is we'll prioritize. We'll make sure that we're focusing on the sustaining our ability to realize the growth opportunities in a lot of these businesses, which are growing right now. One thing that came out today is it's a story of the multiple growth drivers across Agilent. Clearly, we're having some near-term challenges right now in analytical instrumentation business, yet pathology is growing well. NSE is growing well, services, consumables.\",)\n",
      "(\"So… So yes, I think what we see from our funnels is that they're growing, but the velocity in closing deals from the point of funnel to order is still static on that side -- elongated. Yes. And Derik, I think if we think about the pharma end market, we're assuming very low single-digit growth for next year. And some of that is actually getting past the tougher comps in China. If we looked at actually our pharma business ex China, we grew in FY23. And actually, our biopharma business grew in total. And we think about small molecule was the area that was dragging the pharma business down as you know very well, that typically has a replacement cycle. We are well into that replacement cycle. We were up very high. We kept calling it. And we've seen that be very depressed, and our expectation is that will start coming back in earnest in '24, but probably in the back half of '24. So this goes -- sorry to beat this up, but your China got going down.\",)\n",
      "(\"So again, we described earlier that the business was moving along at a certain overall level. I think we do have a view of China that we will still be down in terms of the revenue for the year. But reflective of where we are, where we're seeing the business right now. So…  Dan, and to build on Mike's point, just a couple of other additional data points. we were down pretty significantly in all end markets in Q4, as you would expect because we were up 44% in Q4 of '22. And so that's probably not as relevant because we were catching up relative to some of the catch-up of the Shanghai shutdown. Another data point, though, is if we looked at kind of year-on-year growth actually, we exited October, the year-on-year performance. It was still a decline, but it was much better than what we saw at the beginning of the quarter. And so we actually saw a sequential improvement. I think Mike mentioned that in his prepared remarks. And then if we looked at kind of absolute dollars, they've been pretty steady month-on-month. Got it.\",)\n",
      "(\"So we're very active. The volume is less commercial this year as we pointed out in the script as well versus clinical. And Bob, I know we've been talking a lot with the team about the outlook for the year, particularly with some of our customers who are resequencing some of the clinical programs into '25. Yes. Derik. And as you're talking about, we remain very optimistic about the future of NASD, our forecast for Train C and D remains intact in terms of building out the expansion. I would say that as we're talking about things, you mentioned one of the clinical trials. That's an important element of one of our customers. We are seeing some potential pushouts into FY '25. And as they are looking at revisiting the clinical trial programs and time lines and it's probably closer to flat this year based on that, although we're not giving up hope but that's built into kind of keeping our guide the way it is. But I think if you look at the number of commercial programs -- or excuse me, clinical programs that we have, we're very excited about the future.\",)\n",
      "(\"[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Congratulations, Mike. And good luck. So first question, we've been getting a lot of incomings on the NASD business. And just because the growth trajectory is not doing what I think what people had thought it was going to do this year. I assume there's a couple of questions. It's like, look, there's been some pushouts in some clinical readouts from Alnylam with their HELIOS-B trial, there's been some other sort of like developments in the market. I guess the question is like, are you still confident that, that segment can grow this year, NASD can grow this year? And I just -- is there any risk at all that there's like an overcapacity situation because as the market -- is it just taking longer for things to catch up? Just sort of your thoughts on that, please? I'll tag team with Bob on this. So as you saw in our prepared remarks, Q1 came in as expected for the NASD business. And we are in a situation where we've had, I think, the broadest number of clinical programs and such.\",)\n",
      "(\"The actual number of programs that are in various stages has literally doubled over the last 4 years. And then in terms of pharma partners, we're not in a position today to share anything publicly. But I already said we're working with more than 30 pharma partners. And I think what's encouraging for us is even within pharma, the caliber of the companies that have now entered and advancing molecules at various stages. So this is a market that is maturing the number of FDA approvals that have happened, European approvals that have happened. So there's momentum in the market.\",)\n",
      "(\"Maybe just one add, Dan, is obviously a difficult decision for us, but I also think it also looks - it shows the discipline that we have in terms of our portfolio rationalization, and we felt we had better returns in other places to invest in so. Understood. Thanks for the time. You're welcome. We'll go next now to Brandon Couillard at Jefferies. Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Brandon. Mike would you just find packing mass spec versus LC trends in the quarter? And then based on your revised guide, what is the four-year CAGR from 2019 for LSAG instruments exiting the year? How does that compare to historical average over the cycle? Hi Brandon, I'm going to start with the response to your question. I'll let Bob dig through his notes to find the actual number. But first of all, I just started to say, is that we believe what we're dealing with here in our core instrument portfolio, inclusive of LC and LCMS continues to be a macro market story. Our market shares are holding up really well. We're seeing in our one loss data. We're seeing it in the external reports from order.\",)\n",
      "(\"And when you look at the growth rates, you're right, we are expecting growth in the back half of the year. A lot of that is, in fact, the easier the compares. And when we actually look at -- what I would ask you to take a look at also is a 2-year stack basis relative to implied Q1 and first half and second half. And what you would see there is a much more smooth number that we also looked at as well. So as usual, you're spot on there. And Bob, I think that's why we really emphasized in the script, the word stabilization because as things, as we have kind of a stabilization, we're going to get a lift in the growth rate just by the comps as they go. Yes, I know there's a lot of focus on how much improvement is necessary to get there. So if a lot of this is stability is just math that I think obviously makes people more comfortable. I know I've taken up a lot of air time already. Real quick. Capital deployment, the cash flow remains robust. The balance sheet is super clean.\",)\n",
      "(\"Overall, we wrapped up Agilent's first half of fiscal 2023 with double-digit core growth in both revenue and earnings per share. However, continued macroeconomic uncertainty, coupled with stresses in the banking system have accelerated a more conservative approach from our customers across the globe. This has primarily affected CapEx-related instrument spending across most end markets but are centered mainly in the pharma markets in the U.S. and China. Early stage biotech customers, while a small part of our revenues, dramatically scaled back purchases as funding and liquidity challenges drove cash conservation. Outside of these early-stage biotechs, the order funnel continues to be healthy, but it has taken a longer time for order to be approved, slowing deal velocity and generation of new orders. We expect this constrained capital environment to remain in place throughout the course of our fiscal year. Because of these factors, we are taking a more cautious approach to the second half and have revised our forecast downward. As a result, we now expect core revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 4.5%, with EPS growing faster than revenue at 7% to 8%.\",)\n",
      "(\"Pharma, you just basically said you've got -- not -- you don't have a ton of visibility, hope things have come back. I'm just not -- I'm curious why you can put a little bit more cushion in the guide, like that. It just seems like -- it still feels like it's a little bit -- it still feels like it's a little back end. Well, it's not a little a lot back-end heavy, given where we are soaring in the cycle? Yes. I think as we said earlier, Derik, there's reason to believe that you have the comps working in our favor for the second half, there’s real. And we know that customers want there's interest in the products. And I think they've got a step -- and by the way, we're not calling for this miracle snapback in 2024. But we're also saying that small markets continue to decline 20%, 30% on the numbers we're seeing this year, particularly, that's where the pressure has been. But we know that biopharma, they need some tools for R&D. We know that those replacement cycles only last -- can only be held up for so long.\",)\n",
      "(\"So -- and a lot of that has to do with some of the timing associated with that $15 million shift. That's almost all capital equipment from Q1 -- from Q2 back into Q1. So if you look at it, it is in line with where we expect it to be. And then, we go into more favorable compares in Q3 and Q4. Correct, correct. Got it. Okay. And then I know there's been a handful of questions running on China. But can you just -- would you mind spending a bit more color on kind of what maybe by segment, pharma, applied? Any color you can give us kind of what you're seeing within the different businesses in China? And is down mid-single still the expectation for China for the full year? Or is there a chance you can kind of see some upside for that number. I think we've have raised it up a bit. It's still down... Yes, yes. I think we're cautiously optimistic there. I'd say it's still within a range that we had before, so I don't want to call an inflection.\",)\n",
      "(\"Do you want to take the first part, Bob, I think it's... Yes, yes. So well, I think from the standpoint of the comps, what we would see is, obviously, if you looked at what we did in the first half of this year, we had very strong growth, and then we're going up against, extremely difficult comparisons this year. I mean, as I mentioned, we were down -- up 44% in Q4 of last year, so down 31% this year, we're still up over the 2 years. And as we think about this similar to the rest of the kind of the guide, we're expecting kind of declines in the mid-20s in Q1 and getting better from there. And some of that, it will be an easier comp. And I'm sure Mike will talk a little bit more about this, but we don't see anything structurally changing in the Chinese marketplace for life science tools. Absolutely, Bob. Why don't pick up from there. So I made a few comments about this in the prepared remarks, but I may first trip to China since October 2019 when we're there for the [BCIA] show.\",)\n",
      "(\"And then I just wanted to ask about monthly trends. Some of your peers have talked about how spending a bit, a little bit slow out of the gate in January and then into early February. So I guess, since you guys have a few more weeks of visibility here. Can you walk us through where you seeing similar trends on just slower spending to start the year? And has any of that started to come back? Any color there as we enter fiscal 2Q would be helpful. Well, I've been in this business for a while and it's always slow in January. And that's why we have the seasonality we talked about relative to Q2. So I don't think we're seeing any significantly different trends that we've seen historically. Padraig, I know that you're closer than I am but [indiscernible]. Yes. No, I think that's right, Mike. I think on the ACG side, we see a number of service -- our service contract business comes in strong under the ACG side but on the capital side, we're not seeing much. Yes. And Bill, just a final -- put a finer point on that, January came in as we expected.\",)\n",
      "(\"And Mike, I think you also started with that saying that we continue to see a lot of activities in that space, especially in the battery space, where, of course, there are also compares we are against, but there's still a lot of interest in that space, and we are doing very, very well. Semicon is also cycling down right now, but we are - we continue to see business in that space, but not as strong as we did last year. Thanks Jacob. And my follow-up, I wanted to ask about margins. Just how you're thinking about some of the puts and takes for 2024. I think some of the cost savings you've talked about should extend to next year, should get some leverage out of NASD. But at the same time, some of the performance comp comes back and would think some of these top line pressures extend as well. I don't know, can you just talk about maybe relative to the LRP, how you're thinking about margins for next year? Bob, do you want to lead that one? Yes.\",)\n",
      "(\"And Vijay, I'd also point out there is a level of variability in our pay plans tied directly to adjust for the company's performance that are assumed in our guide for second half. Thanks guys. All right. Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Securities. Please go ahead. Yes, hi Mike, Bob, thanks for taking the question. Thanks Mike. So first one is really on, obviously, China, very strong in the quarter. Can you elaborate a bit on sort of the stimulus contribution that happened this quarter? And what are you -- obviously, you're expecting moderation in the second half. Also, if you could talk about if you're seeing anything relevant to the new COVID wave that's emerging there. Is that something baked into your guide and overall just expectations for China for the full year? Yes. Why don't I start out with answering the last question first, and then I'll probably mention to you, Bob, to our guide assumptions.\",)\n",
      "('Our chemicals and advanced materials business delivered strong results once again growing 16%. The advanced materials segment grew more than 20% and the chemical and energy segment grew double digits. On a geographic basis, 32% growth in China exceeded our high expectations. While the compare was an easier one, even adjusting for the COVID lockdowns in Shanghai a year ago, we still achieved double-digit growth in China. In addition, Europe delivered 5% core growth, while Americas grew 3%, albeit against a tough compare of 13% a year ago. Looking at our performance by business unit. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets group delivered revenues of $968 million, up 10% core. Our strong results were aided by backlog conversion across our instrument platforms. Our LC and LCMS products continued to lead the way with 16% growth in the quarter with strength across all end markets. Continued demand for lab consumables led to 13% growth in that business as well. During the quarter, we added additional strength to our LCMS product line by acquiring e-MSion and their innovative electron capture technology. e-MSion technology allows researchers to develop biotherapeutic products more quickly for treating disease.',)\n",
      "(\"And I think we saw some really good strength in small molecule in particular this quarter. Yes, absolutely. I will start by saying, I don't think this is a baseball game. I think there is a continuous opportunity on indicate space. So -- and we see both opportunities and we continue to believe that there is a big market in small molecules. And I think the current performance is a reflection of the investments we have done into -- we made into our portfolio over the past years both for the LC and the CMS. So it's really, really focused very much on where we have gone strategically on a lot of investment into making robust reliable and routine instruments and instrument solutions. We continue to spend significant time to truly understand our customers' pain point that is not only about the overall performance but also about how you can ease of use, a lot of smarts we put into the instruments and of course, also continues on focus on uptime of instruments. And our commercial organization is brilliantly going out and connect both our consumables and also the service contracts to it.\",)\n",
      "(\"And we think that we've tried to do that. We've built in feedback based on the field's projections, the funnel that Mike and Padraig talked about and then an assumption around the conversion of those funnels. And we haven't seen the funnels slow down. There's still modest growth, and we're starting to see the slowing of the elongation. I'm not saying that it's stopped or accelerated in terms of the purchase but we are starting to see that slowing and you're actually seeing that in that book to bill. And when we look at the orders on a sequential basis, we're starting to see that kind of stabilization as well. And so that's kind of how we're looking at continuing to go forward. if you kind of just built that going into next year, you would start seeing a challenging first half and then better performance in the second half. Hopefully, that gives you some flavor. Yes, that's helpful. And that was actually going to be my follow-up. And maybe I don't know, Bob or Mike, if you want to take it.\",)\n",
      "(\"In fact, Padraig, I think you've just done recently around with some of the large pharma accounts and... Yes. So I think what we're seeing is our funnels are very, very stable on it. And of course, you're correct, the pharma budgets are set around this time of the year. And I think we're watching closely on how that moves to the second half but for now, no change. So I think we probably haven't seen any surprises on those like themselves but they're not aggressively releasing yet either. I think that's -- that's why I made a few times on this call comments around normalization of deal cycle times. And we'll take our next question now from Lisa Garcia of UBS. Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to talk about sell analysis if we could. Obviously, it's like a $400 million business over for you at this point. I'd love to hear about performance. And then I think in a recent presentation, kind of indicated that it's pharma that's like maybe the largest customer set followed by research. So it would be great to get a sense of kind of the different customer groups and what you're seeing there?\",)\n",
      "(\"You have to have the instrumentation QA/QC environment to support that. That requires you to have modern liquid chromatography fleets. So, I don't think it's a question that they can - that this market is going to go away and won't be an area that the pharma will need to invest in. You can defer for a period of time, but then only last for so long. Thank you. We'll go next now to Patrick Donnelly at Citi. Hi guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Mike, maybe just given that commentary around the instrument cycle, you're not really seeing much improvement yet. Obviously, the China piece transitory, but certainly seems like it's going to linger. You only a couple of months in '24 for you guys here. How do you think about some of these impacts lingering in? I think you said there's still plans for growth next year, but it certainly sounds like some of the headwinds at least will linger into the first half, given some of those costs. I just wanted to talk through that top line setup given some of these headwinds lingering into next year? Yes.\",)\n",
      "(\"So for China, we are thinking mid-single-digit decline for the full year. So very similar to this year. And then for NASD, right now, we're expecting low single-digit -- mid-single-digit growth. Mid-singles. Yes. We go next now to Patrick Donnelly at Citi. Maybe kind of a follow-up on the 1Q guide. It seems like, again, the order's encouraging. Maybe a little bit prudent on the guide, as you said, I guess when you think about just the implication for the ramp 2Q to 4Q, is it optimism in the market based on some of those order trends is that obviously the comps get easier in the second half as you work through it. And can you just talk about the visibility into the recovery and kind of what gives you the confidence in the ramp as the year progresses here? Yes, sure, Patrick. I want in lead off, Bob, and then you can add any additional comments you'd like to make here. But when we think about these comps around what we described as a gradual recovery and grow.\",)\n",
      "(\"I'll then turn things over to Bob for more detail on the quarter and outlook before returning for some brief closing comments. In an increasingly challenging market environment, the Agilent team delivered very solid results in the second quarter. Revenues of $1.72 billion are up 9.5% core above our expectations with growth across all end markets and regions. Our results are driven by an innovative and broad portfolio, a differentiated customer experience and outstanding execution by the Agilent team. Operating margin for the quarter 25.6%, up 30 basis points. Earnings per share of $1.27 are up 12%. Highlights from an end market perspective include our two largest markets, pharma and chemicals and advanced materials performing very well in the quarter. Our pharma business grew 6% on top of 13% growth last year. Pharma was led by biopharma, which grew 16% driven by lab services, consumables and our NASD business, while small molecule declined 1%. In previous calls, we talked about the small molecule replacement cycle and that the exceptional double-digit growth rates we've seen in the past two years would eventually moderate, which is what we started to see this quarter.\",)\n",
      "(\"And I think what we see is as also consumables and services continue to outperform expectations in China, so that's kind of we expect that to continue. Yes, I think the story is a great. I think the story really was in pharma, Q1, the instrument and the CapEx side of things. But we're pleased with the start there. Your next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Maybe first, when pharma was down 12% in the quarter. I think you said biopharma was up 2% ex China. What was small molecule performance ex China. And maybe the outlook for biopharma versus a small molecule for the rest of the year? So small molecule on a global basis was down roughly 18%. And it was ex China, it was down 20% and down roughly 14% for China. So pretty consistent across the globe. I would say, in China, the big area in China that has been impacted is on the small molecule side, where we'll start to see better comps going forward after Q2. Okay. And then maybe on consumables, it's great to see a return to growth there this quarter.\",)\n",
      "(\"On the other hand, just given some math, your guidance for the first half embeds the assumption that revenue declines around 7% organically and then improves 7% to 9% positive organic in the second half. Can you could do that just as a function of the comps? Or do you actually really need to see improvement in certain geographies or certain end markets or categories? And then again, just a math question. Does guidance assume Q4 revenue kind of exiting around like $1.8 billion? Doug, this is Bob. I'll take that last one. We'll tell you when we get to Q4 and what I would say but your math is -- in all seriousness, your math is spot on as usual. I think one of the things that we look at is, we look at it a couple of different ways. I think the way to look at it is that first half, second half kind of looking at seasonality, that's probably more instructive given kind of the changes in the growth rates. And when you look at it, as you noticed -- as you mentioned, it is in line with our historical seasonality.\",)\n",
      "(\"We now expect core growth for the full year to be around 1%, down from our previous guide. Based on what we're seeing at this time, we're not assuming any improvement in the China market for the remainder of the year. We, however, view the near-term challenges we're experiencing as transitory and remain confident about the long-term growth prospects of our end markets. Before turning now to our third quarter results, I'd like to touch on our two largest end markets. Our total pharma business is down 8%, driven by the pharma market in China being down 30%. Within pharma, our biopharma business grew 5%, while small molecule was down 16%. The Chemical Advanced Materials market declined 3% versus a 22% increase last year. While we did see the chemical energy space being weighed down by macro concerns, slowing growth in Advanced Materials was more a function of a difficult compare as the volumes have remained steady and robust. Looking at our performance by business unit. The Life Science and Applied Markets have delivered revenues of $927 million. This was a decline of 9% of a very tough compare of 18% growth.\",)\n",
      "(\"This charge, which is excluded from non-GAAP results, includes an impairment write-down along with charges associated with the wind-down and exit of the business. We expect the wind down to continue through Q4 and into early FY '24. Now to the revised outlook for the year in Q4. Given the more challenging macroeconomic environment we are seeing, particularly in China, we now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $6.80 billion to $6.85 billion. This represents a decline of 0.7% to flat on a reported basis and core growth of 0.8% to 1.5%. This is a core growth reduction of 260 basis points from the midpoint of our last guide. Roughly 85% of the change is related to reduced expectations in China while the remainder is due to some incremental cautiousness from our customers on CapEx spend as well as softness in genomics and the shutdown of Resolution Bioscience. As Mike said earlier, we are not assuming any incremental stimulus in China or any material year-end budget flush in these revised projections.\",)\n",
      "(\"It's roughly closer to 3% for the full company in terms of revenue. And your last question is the toughest question, which is, sort of, if you will, your crystal ball question. We've typically seen 12- to 18-month kind of cycles historically. And as Jacob and I and Bob have talked in the past, we've always felt that this is more of a mid-single-digit kind of growth market with -- for instruments, which is still very healthy end market growth rate and particularly when you build around at the service and consumables piece. We're not calling for that yet to occur for this year. So I think the only other thing I would say is for a large majority of our instrument business it is a replacement cycle. We've talked about that time and time again. And so these products are in the installed base. They will have to be replaced. The question is when. And again, interest and demand remains high. I mean, our backlog is strong. As we mentioned in prior calls, and I just -- we emphasized that again today.\",)\n",
      "(\"It's our chemical customers in China, albeit the advanced materials piece of the China market continues to hold up quite nicely. And Padraig, I know you've been in conversations with our China sales leader. What are you hearing from them? Yes. No, I think you said it well, Mike. It's a very similar dynamics in China from what we're seeing in the rest of the world, which is quite simply customers have become more conservative CapEx budgets and spending decisions, albeit on the EV markets and so on, that's a particular strength that we're going to continue to see. But I think that's what we're seeing. Yes. Great. And then one market you didn't call out in CAM was the PFAS testing. I was wondering if you could give us an update on that and just how you're -- if there's been a change in terms of the market dynamics there? I think we remain very positive on that, Jacob, right? Yes, absolutely. I think that we are still in the -- to use the baseball term, the early innings. Yes, American baseball terms. I think I am, but we certainly are early innings here.\",)\n",
      "(\"Yes, if I look at Q2 guide, we're still expecting, if I looked at the end market pharma down double-digits academia and government down low single digits really as a result of some of that timing shift, diagnostics and clinical down mid-singles and chemical and advanced materials, down high single digits and food about the same. Both of those are, as a result of some of the shift also in the China business from Q2 back into Q1 and then environmental and forensics kind of mid-single-digit decline. Our final question will come from the line of Paul Knight with KeyBanc. Mike, really super to see you love doing what you're doing and I knew you, I don't know, 15 years before you became CEO. So I guess, concluding question I would have, at least professionally, would be what do you see in terms of two things. Number one, why do you think the kind of market growth rate is for the markets that Agilent participates in? And then geographically, where do you see the surprise over the next 5 years? Like will Japan reinvigorate its growth? Will Europe see more in-sourcing?\",)\n",
      "(\"And then again, I would just remind you, Matt, some of the points we made in the call, record renewals for support contracts and also clearly taking share on the enterprise level. Those attach rates we keep talking about are going up as well. So a lot to like here. Great. And then maybe just kind of refresh us on your outlook for instruments. I mean you've kind of guided to a mid-single-digit growth for the full year. Given that we're a little ways into this year, you probably have a little more visibility on that backlog. How are you thinking about sort of the back half for instruments overall? Yes. So first of all, let me -- I'm taking a bit on this with Bob but let's -- I'll talk about the backlog, first of all, I think it's very important to just to remind the audience that the quality of our backlog remains extremely high. So -- and you can see the great work of our team at to work down the backlog but we're not seeing any cancellations or anything pulling out of backlog. So that gives us level of confidence around the revenues we can forecast.\",)\n",
      "(\"The environmental and forensics market declined 1% after growing 12% in Q1 of last year. We continue to see new regulations around the world driving PFAS testing. Europe grew mid-single digits, while China and the Americas were down low single digits. Americas faced a difficult compare of low 30s growth last year. The food market declined 3% but was up low single digits, excluding China. On a geographic basis, as Mike mentioned, both China and Europe exceeded our expectations while the Americas were in line with our expectations. China was down 9% and showed a sequential increase over last quarter which was much better than expectations. China benefited from continued stabilization and a bigger-than-expected Lunar New Year impact as some customers pulled forward incremental demand from Q2. We estimate the pull-forward impact to be roughly $15 million or 5% of China's revenue in the quarter. Even adjusting for this impact, China outperformed. Europe was down 4% year-on-year after growing 10% last year and was up mid-single digits sequentially. This was driven by continued strong demand for our ACG services, offset by muted demand in pharma and expected softness in chemicals.\",)\n",
      "('The new products we launched in June at ASMS, in particular the 6595 LC triple quad, which is focused on key applications like PFAS, continue to generate positive customer interest and new orders. We’re also bringing innovative new solutions for customers across the biopharma value chain. We have installed a number of our online UHPLC systems with large biopharma companies. The systems are easy-to-use, reliable, and deliver significant value by providing fully automated analysis of critical quality attributes and allowing real time decision making outside the lab. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $404 million, up 4% core and 6% on a reported basis. ACG delivered growth across all end-markets, and in all regions except China. The contract services business was up double-digits, offset by the services associated with new instrument placements. Our strategy of increasing the connect rate continues to pay off. In the quarter, the contract services business represented 65% of ACG revenue, a number that has grown nicely over the years. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $356 million, flat on a core basis and up 1% reported. DGG’s results were led by the pathology and NASD businesses, which both delivered low double-digit growth.',)\n",
      "(\"With the change in revenue, we now expect full year fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $5.40 and $5.43, representing leveraged earnings growth of 3% to 4% and roughly 6% to 7% growth net of currency. The change in full year guide results in Q4 revenue being in the range of $1.655 billion to $1.705 billion. This represents a decline of 8% to 10.5% on a reported basis and a decline of 9.5% to 12% on a core basis. The recovery last year in Q4 of the remaining revenue deferred from the Shanghai Q2 shutdown negatively impacts the year-on-year results by roughly 1 point. In fourth quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.33 and $1.36. Thanks for being on the call. And now I will turn things back over to Mike for some closing comments before taking your questions. Mike? Thanks, Bob. While today's macroenvironment is challenged for new instrument purchases, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of our end markets, the diversification of our business and in our proven ability to grow faster than the market.\",)\n",
      "(\"I know last quarter, you guys started eating into the backlog a little bit which is natural, just given the supply chain is normalizing a little bit. Can you just talk about, I guess, order growth versus revenue growth, what you saw in the quarter? And any color there would be helpful. Yes. Let me make some summary comments and then Bob, feel free to jump in here. But as you mentioned, we don't specifically provide book-to-bill ratios. But what I can tell you is that orders for the quarter were greater than revenue. So -- and so we continue to grow orders with particular strength in our ASD and the services business. On the instrument side, we continue to bring down this record backlog we had as we really are focused on meeting those customer shipment requirements and really thanks to the great work of the order fulfillment team, we've really been able to get back to a normal flow of shipment times and delivery commitments. Again, I would just say that the funnels remain healthy, the backlog is still a very high quality. I think we have pretty much next to no cancellations. So the quality is good.\",)\n",
      "(\"It has the potential to do that. And as we talked about it, we're at the beginning of the year, and so we want to be prudent there. But there's nothing out there that doesn't say that, that should continue given the macro economic environment and the incentives that governments are providing to continue to invest. And actually, what we're seeing is nice business in Southeast Asia as well as India. And I would expect that to continue. That's where we're placing incremental investments to continue to drive and capture that demand. I would expect the same thing in the environmental area as well. But we're not going to build all of that in right now at the beginning of the year. But I think we saw some trends too that we're starting to see, PFAS is also now driving some testing in the food marketplace as well as every country that we talk to is in the process of further enhancing their own reg. So we wanted to have some other areas of potential growth for the company beyond the story around pharma. We'll go next now to Josh Waldman at Cleveland Research.\",)\n",
      "(\"Agilent's LSAG team continued to bring several innovative new products to market, including enhancements to our Bravo NGS automation, Cary UV-Vis and the cell analysis NovoCyte systems. Many of these enhancements are specifically focused on serving our customers in the biopharma market. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenues of $387 million. This is up 13% core driven by strong revenues from service contracts. ACG's growth was broad-based, representing ongoing resilient demand for our services. We continue to see many opportunities for future growth given our services portfolio. In particular, the benefits of our service offerings as they help customers drive productivity in lab are even more relevant in today's challenging environment. Our strong and trusted customer support is also helping us to drive share gains and acquire new enterprise customers. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenues of $362 million, up 3% core. Strength in our pathology and NASD businesses drove growth, partially offset by general industry-wide weakness in genomics. NASD posted another strong quarter growing in the high 20s. Our Train B manufacturing expansion remains on track to come online later this quarter, while construction has already started on the next phase of expansion.\",)\n",
      "(\"And Bob, I think it's also fair to say that this is not a byproduct of overcapacity in the industry or a significant change in in-sourcing. It's really how some of our customers are reacting to really the IRAC. That's right. Well, that takes me -- that's a great segue into my next question which is what's sort of the latest on pharma? It doesn't sound like you're ready to call an inflection point but it does sound like things sounded a little bit better. Can you just sort of give your thoughts on what budget releases are sort of timing around that? Any sort of like notable developments? I mean, when do you -- are you seeing any sort of like signs of life that -- or the signs of budgets could start to be released in the second quarter? Yes. Great question, Derik. Obviously, top of mind, within Agilent, as we mentioned, Q1 came in where we thought it would. But what's the outlook? And Padraig, I know you've just spending a lot of time with your team and customers talking about this exact question. Yes. Thanks, Mike. And I think customers continue to be cautious globally.\",)\n",
      "(\"How it may progress because I'm just trying to make sense of the guidance. You guys did double digits in the first half. And we went from double digits to low single-digit declines. Just frame us this pace of slowdown. Is there any historical analogies when you see these kinds of slowdowns? Do these things last like a couple of quarters or is this like four quarters? And I'm assuming this guide change so far, it's only pharma, correct? Like we're not reflecting any other end market changes? So there's a lot to unpack there. Bob, so you and I maybe can tag team on this. But let's first of all talk about the pace of business. So as you're right, Vijay, it really is a tale of two cities. I mean, look at how we performed for the first half, double-digit core growth, double-digit EPS growth, continued margin expansion. But we saw -- and we have been signaling a level of cautiousness in our customer base, and we talked about the uncertainty that was assumed in our second half guide. We've been talking about that for a few quarters.\",)\n",
      "(\"It would be upside relative to our current outlook, and we know we do well in these markets. But Padraig, I don't think we're seeing and hearing anything like along those lines. No, I think it's spot on, Mike. The only thing I would say, Rachel, is if we look at our funnels, they continue to be growing. So it's a question of when, not if, and particularly in pharma. And as Mike and Padraig just mentioned, we're not assuming a budget flush into our Q4. And if it happens, that would likely happen in our Q1 in any event, from a revenue perspective. But what we see at least from our funnels, is they continue to be helping. And let me just answer Brandon's question from a couple of times ago. If I look at LC and LCMS on a three-year CAGR, they're between 7% and 9%, so higher than the overall LSAG average. Right. Thanks for that and Bob. And Rachel, I think the second question relative to - I think you're referring to the small molecule replacement cycle.\",)\n",
      "('As an encouraging data point, for the quarter our book-to-bill ratio was 1 for the company and greater than 1 for our LSAG instruments. Let’s take a closer look at our Q4 performance, starting with our regional results. During the quarter, while down year-on-year, we delivered sequential growth except for China, as expected. In China, our business declined 31% year-on-year after growing 44% in Q4 last year. While China was down sequentially, these results were very much in line with our expectations. And the year-on-year monthly performance improved slightly as the quarter progressed. In addition, orders were slightly higher than revenue for the quarter. While it is too early to call these two data points a trend, we see this as an encouraging sign of potential stabilization. In late September, I traveled to China for the first time since the COVID outbreak to meet with the Agilent team, key customers, and government officials. I was reminded of both the sheer size of the Chinese economy and our market there. I saw first-hand the work being done to bolster economic activity in the near-term and create an environment that will support continued growth into the future.',)\n",
      "(\"Maybe one for Bob and then one for Mike. Bob, maybe circling back on Derik's question, I wondered if you could provide more context on the forecasting process this round or the puts and takes that went into the organic guide. Could you take a step back, were there segments in the business that were like decelerating or slowing as you went into the guide or maybe areas where you're still trying to find bottom? And if so, how did you expect that in the guide? Yes. Obviously, this year has been one for the ages in terms of being able to try to manage the forecasting. And so we've taken a number of different angles at it to look at it. So not only growth rates, which I think is the focus here, but also actually if you looked at it on a sequential basis and look at the actual dollars, I think that that's probably more instructive, particularly as we were looking at the bleeding of the inventory. I would say what we've seen over the last couple of quarters is that signs of stabilization. There are always puts and takes across the various businesses.\",)\n",
      "(\"Adjusting for the China deferral in Q3 of last year would add roughly 200 basis points to both reported and core growth in the quarter. Currency and M&A impact in Q3 are minimal, and are expected to offset each other. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.36 and $1.38, representing growth of 1.5% to 3% versus the prior year. We are pleased with the first half performance, and while we are facing a more difficult market environment than we were estimating a quarter ago, I am confident that our team will continue to deliver for our customers. Thanks for being on the call. And now I'll turn over things back to Mike for some closing comments before we take your questions. Mike? Thanks, Bob. During Q4 '22 call in November, I shared with you that I believe Agilent has the right growth strategies, the right team and right culture to continue delivering strong above-market results. My belief remains unchanged. Our customers know we are reliable, resilient and extremely quick in reacting to meet their needs. The Agilent team continues to work hard to earn their trust.\",)\n",
      "(\"And so I think it's the normal kind of cadence of business. And that's why, as Bob just mentioned, when we're talking about the second half, we bank some of the beat to put again the second half because we've yet to see the second half materialize in terms of the order book which is typical at this time of the year. I think that's right, Mike. And I think as far as the quality of orders remains -- that remain in our backlog, nothing has changed. We've not seen any increase in cancellations and ex China the funnel continues to grow and that's led by the aftermarket business. I will say as a continuing theme, the deal closure times remain at an elevated levels but it's definitely stable and deal win rates have been consistent. Yes. I think there's been an important point made here, elevated but we're not seeing the elongation. So they're stable but they're longer than they have been in the past. Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with UBS. My first question, just a bit more on China. Are you expecting sequential growth in Q2 in China similar to Q1?\",)\n",
      "(\"In addition, we're also raising our full year EPS guidance to a new range of $5.65 to $5.70 per share. And lastly, given the recently announced NASD expansion to double our oligo manufacturing capacity -- we are updating our forecasted capital spending for the year to $500 million, up $200 million from our guidance at the beginning of the year. Now turning to Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $1.655 billion to $1.680 billion. This represents core growth of 6% to 7.5% and reported growth of 3% to 4.5%. Currency is expected to be a headwind of 3.1 points, while M&A will contribute 0.1 points of growth in Q2 which is consistent with Q1. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.24 and $1.27, representing growth of 10% to 12% versus the prior year. I'm pleased with how the team has delivered in the first quarter. We are focused on the things we can control. Our team is driving strong execution in the marketplace and coupled with our broad portfolio of products and services, we expect to continue to grow faster than the market as we go through the year.\",)\n",
      "(\"I appreciate all that perspective. And just a follow-up. I was hoping you could elaborate on your decision to shut down Res Bio. I was surprised by that, given that you acquired the company only a couple of years ago? Yes, sure Dan. Happy to do so. So obviously, a very difficult decision, then I'll have Sam jump in on this conversation, but our fundamental belief was that our differentiation will be all around what we called the kitted strategy to have a distributed on market companion diagnostics for our pharma partners, and that market really hasn't developed as we had anticipated. Sam? Yes, Mike. Building on what you said, while NGS and cancer diagnostics is here and we serve that market in a number of ways, right, for just to be clear, too. We absolutely continue to serve cancer research translational research and diagnostic, test developer customers. But our core to our thesis, our differentiation is really the ability to develop and distribute these kitted tests in the market, the pharma market and the testing market just as evolve that way.\",)\n",
      "(\"I was curious if you could maybe quantify where the funnel stands entering '24 versus maybe where it typically is entering the year? And just how correlative or how much do you think it is a predictor of near-term demand? I mean is that -- is better funnel conversion at all kind of part of what drives the improvement as you progress through the year? I think pursuant to Padraig and Bob, kind of the same rates, right, no significant improvement. Correct. We're going up against -- the first half of this year, actually, what you saw was the elongation of those cycle times. And so what we're seeing right now is kind of -- like I said, it's not necessarily fully stable, but it's not decline -- or increasing at the rate that we saw in the first and second quarters of last year. And so you're starting to see that. And so all things being equal, that conversion is actually improving slightly versus a year ago. It's still not back to historical numbers. And that's what we're trying to handicap here as we look at our forecast going forward. We'll go next now to Daniel Brennan at Cowen.\",)\n",
      "(\"I would love to have your perspective on those things. Thanks, Paul. Yes, we do go way back to don't we and it's been great to work with you over those years, going way back to the CAG days in my prior role, I think we think this is a 4% to 6% kind of growth market, mid-singles. So we think that the kind of market growth that we're not experienced in the industry right now is the anomalies and this will be back to that 4% to 6% kind of long-term growth rate. Obviously, certain segments within that overall macro number, that big TAM will be growing faster than that and that's always a challenge to make sure that you pick those segments so you can actually beat that number. I think there's going to be some geographic mix. I mean, we've evolved our view of long-term growth into China because we actually expect some of the supply chain moves and other things that have been going on that you'll see a growth, more growth in Europe which has been more of a slower grower for us geographically.\",)\n",
      "('Although no shares were repurchased during the quarter, we expect to catch up on our anti-dilutive share repurchasing for the remainder of the year. In Q2, we expect a minimum of $180 million to be repurchased. All in all, we had a good start to the year. And as Mike mentioned, it reinforces our confidence in the full year guide we provided in November. Now, to our guidance for the second quarter. We expect Q2 revenue will be in the range of $1.56 billion to $1.59 billion. This represents a decline of 9.1% to 7.4% on a reported basis and a decline of 8.4% to 6.7% on a core basis against 9% growth last year. Currency and M&A combined are a headwind of 70 basis points. Our Q2 guidance also reflects the $15 million impact of the Q1 pull forward in China I mentioned earlier. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share expected to be between $1.17 and $1.20. Before turning back over to Mike, I just want to express my thanks to Mike and to congratulate Padraig. Mike, it has been a real pleasure to work with you.',)\n",
      "(\"I think is, first of all, important to remind the audience that we do expect the first half of the year to be very much like what we saw in the second half of '23. But looking forward, why do we think that things are going to be different in the second half which is though it's initial and still early, there are some early signs of potential stabilization that you see in our order book. The fact that book-to-bill for the company was above 1, the fact that we had the same result in our instrument business, which has been the most pressured part of the company. And listen, while it's too early for customers to be confirming their 2024 budgets with us, let's go back to the sales phone, which is a predictor of potential growth, right? So our sales funnels continue to show a lot of interest from customers. And we know that at some point in time of things will start to release. The funnels remain healthy. And listen, an environment like this, we've seen these things before, which was healthy capital spending has been constrained. So some release can be expected.\",)\n",
      "('The growth was generated by the build-out of water infrastructure projects and an expansion of funding for PFAS-related activities. The food market grew 1% based on strength in Asia outside of China and mid-single-digit growth in Europe, driven by new food testing regulations. On a geographic basis, while China underperformed, the Americas and the rest of Asia were better than expected, while Europe was in line with our expectations. Moving down the P&L. Third quarter gross margin was 56.3%, down 10 basis points from a year ago. Like last quarter, this was largely due to the product and services mix, and pricing was slightly better than our expectations. Below gross margin, the expense reduction actions we initiated in the second quarter helped strengthen operating margins. We also benefited from a reduction in variable pay expenses. As Mike mentioned, margins were 29.3%, up 180 basis points from last year. Below the line, our interest income was higher than planned, while our tax rate was 13.75% and we had 295 million diluted shares outstanding. Putting it all together, Q3 earnings per share were $1.43, up 7% from a year ago, a very good result given declining revenue.',)\n",
      "(\"But we're expecting a slight uptick there, given the strong performance that we had in Q1. Great. And maybe just one on the balance sheet. Obviously, the -- it's in great shape, leverage is very low. Just wondering what you're seeing from the M&A environment. Obviously, Waters had a deal in the quarter. I'm wondering what you're seeing in terms of -- have you identified any interesting opportunities like what's the appetite like for sellers to kind of move forward? Just wondering what we could expect for management while it's always hard at time. I'm just kind of wondering about your appetite potential to do something bigger since you guys have been looking for the right fit. Yes. No, I think you're closing -- happy to comment on the day your closing comments exactly where our head is at which is the right fit. So we think the environment is much more favorable than it was a year ago. We think it's now much more of a buyer's market, so to speak. Most people are willing to come off at a view of last round. There's still some dialogue around there.\",)\n",
      "('While we expect to see recovery during the year in China, our initial view is it will still decline for the full year. From a business group perspective, we expect growth in both DGG and ACG, while LSAG instruments will still be pressured. In terms of phasing, we expect the first half of FY24 to look similar to the second half of FY23, with growth in the second half of next year. We are projecting modest operating margin expansion for the year. Below the line, we expect interest income and expense to offset each other, a tax rate of 13.5%, and 293 million shares outstanding. Fiscal 2024 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.44 to $5.55. This range represents flat to 2% growth versus FY23. From a cash flow perspective, we expect another robust year. We are expecting roughly $1.6 billion in operating cash flow and $400 million in CapEx as spending increases on NASD’s Train C and D expansions. Looking to Q1 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $1.555 billion to $1.605 billion. This represents a core decline of 11.3% to 8.5% with currency and M&A having a minimal impact.',)\n",
      "(\"Just give us your state of the union there, what you're seeing from a macro's perspective and kind of outlook for that business moving into the second half look like? Yes. So I'll do a tag team on this with Padraig. So as you may recall, we've talked earlier this year about these secular growth drivers in the applied markets. And we saw that pretty much across the globe. And I think what we're seeing again is the investments being made in advanced materials relative to the semiconductor supply chain and also the fab is driving productivity. We're seeing continued investment relative to battery, battery development, QA/QC. And I think we continue to see some real nice growth in the PFAS side of our environmental business. Started in the U.S., I think all those applied market secular drivers that we've been pointing to for, for some time, delivered in Q1. And I think our outlook remains the same that we're expecting there'll be a source of positivity for us in the overall CAM [ph] market space, albeit the chemical market is expected to remain subdued. Yes. That's right, Mike. I think it's really a tale of two submarkets.\",)\n",
      "(\"And then I'm going to pass it over to Sam and maybe you want to remind, Brandon, what our plans are with the new expansion, when we expect to see some of that first revenue coming into Agilent. Yes. Yes, happy to do so. And as you mentioned, Mike, first of all, we're tracking right on plan for Train B, right, midpoint -- midyear coming on. And it was great to see first-hand, Bob joined me really the progress that we're making, the facility is looking really, really nice. A lot of validation work happening miles and miles of stainless steel piping and other infrastructure that's been put in place. As you also noted, we did at the end of February, the middle of February, pardon me, the groundbreaking for trains, C and D. And these projects will take some time but we've started the process and the first revenue from that would be coming online in 2025. And remember, there's 2 trains, Train C and Train D, both dedicated to siRNA, antisense capabilities as well as expanding our ability to serve customers with single guide RNA or CRISPR.\",)\n",
      "(\"If that would occur, that would be upside to our forecast for the year as we're assuming really no change in the current environment and no stimulus is assumed in our second half guide. And Bob, I know we've made some adjustments to the outlook for China for the year? Yes. Puneet, if we look at Q2, we always assumed that Q2 was going to be a very strong, given what we were facing on an easier comp, and we talked about that in our prepared remarks, where Shanghai was shut down for roughly six weeks. That deferred roughly $50 million to $55 million of revenue that's now showing up in Q3 and Q4 of last year, which will make it much tougher comps. And to give you a perspective, last year, we went minus 3% in Q2, 29% growth and then 44% growth. So we're always expecting moderated growth expectations in the back half of the year just given that tough comp. Now what we've seen is not a pickup in the performance in the marketplace, particularly in pharma, which we were expecting coming out of kind of the first quarter after the elimination of the zero COVID.\",)\n",
      "(\"So this just continues to be a great business for Agilent. Yes, Rachel, maybe -- this is Bob, maybe I can add a few points because we talked at the beginning of the year, about this strong performance kind of normalizing this year. We also said if it continues, we're going to take it. And I think what you're seeing is some of that as well. But we still do think that this will normalize over time. And the portfolio that Jacob and team have I think speaks very well to us growing faster than the market. And I think you talked about the biopharma, the beauty of our business is we've got that nice diversification across both small -- and small and large molecule and certainly starting up the year very nicely. We'll go next now to Derik DeBruin [ph] of Bank of America. This is Peter [ph] on for Derik. Could you just dive a bit more into the latest on what you're seeing in Europe? You've expressed in bending some caution, particularly in Chem on the last call. So if you can touch on that as well, that would be great. Yes.\",)\n",
      "(\"So if you just flush out like what you're assuming for the rest of the year for emerging biopharma and then kind of what does that imply for the commercial biopharma? And I didn't hear any as well for LSAG. Like did you guys talk about what you're expecting LSAG to do in the back half of the year? Yes, I would say -- let me take the last one first. Our LSAG business, where we were assuming for the full year kind of mid-single-digit growth with it front-end loaded, we're now expecting low single digits, just above 0. So we're actually expecting a decline in both the second -- third quarter and fourth quarter for LSAG driven in part by the emerging biotech and the small molecule. In terms of the biopharma, biopharma actually in total grew 16% in the Q2 results, and that was benefited obviously from NASD. If you took NASD out, it was 11%. So what we saw was this change in the quarter, and we're assuming that change will stay pretty consistent in the back half of the year. Got it. Okay.\",)\n",
      "(\"Some of your peers have talked about maybe that large pharma budget just being delayed coming back later in the year. Curious what you're embedding in kind of your outlook and how you're bringing those two customer bases? Sure. Happy to do so, Brandon. So I think there are differences between the two sectors. The small biotech is pretty much shut down. We've seen real efforts on cash conservation as they've been dealing with the financing challenges of less venture capital money out there, banking crises and limited access to the IPO market. But on the medium-sized and large pharma companies, we still see a very -- actually, an increasing level of conservatism coming from new capital investments, particularly as it relates to our business in instruments. You can make a case that perhaps, there'll be a year-end budget flush, if customers go to try to spend their year-end money that they're not spending now. We're not assuming that because all we can really comment on right now is what we're seeing today. We're not giving any indications that that situation will change.\",)\n",
      "(\"You've heard some conversation of budget cuts there. Are you starting to see that? Just how is your visibility into some of these cyclical areas? Yes. So as we've talked earlier - thanks for the question and Jack and comments and then have Jacob jump in on this one as well. But we look across the CAM, I'd say the Advanced Materials segment of that market, which we've communicated is more driven by secular trends and cyclical trends continues to hold up quite well. And by the way, also, I just want to point out we had a really tough compare, I think we grew 22% last year in Q3 in CAM. If we look at the chemicals and energy side of it, the energy side actually popped up a bit, particularly driven by the U.S. where we are seeing some weakness is in the chemical side where customers are looking at the macroeconomic environment and are slowing their capital investment there. So I'd say that kind of puts and takes.\",)\n",
      "(\"So we think that we're in the early stage of therapeutic discovery here in terms of RNA, siRNA-based therapies and there will just be more larger indications as those move through the clinic. Absolutely. Great, thanks guys. You're welcome. Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon. So I have one more question on China. Obviously, great quarter even if you exclude the comps. But you're talking about some incremental caution here. Can you talk about like what customers in the China region you're seeing. Some of this incremental caution, is CDMOs one of those? Just any color on specific customers in the region would be great. Yes, sure. Maybe I'll tag team with you, Padraig, on this one. So as Bob mentioned, even adjusting for the Shanghai shutdown last year, we did 10% core in China in Q2. We are bumping up some pretty hefty comparisons, 29% and 44%, if I remember the numbers correctly, for Q3 and Q4. But I would say that the China market is really reflective of what we're seeing in the United States as well. So it's our pharma customers in China.\",)\n",

Before we get into discussing our results and outlook, I want to mention that we're joined today by Padraig McDonnell, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group; and Sam Raha, President of the Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group.

      "('And we continue to see demand from the semicon industry, both in the fabs but also in the upstream for all the fine chemicals that goes into the fabs, they require the same level of QC testing like they do in the labs and hence, they are using the same instruments. So we see a lot of benefits. Those were the new fabs built but also for the continuous operation in the labs. So we expect this to continue for a while. We, of course, see a lot of news around investments into this in other parts of the world, also particularly in the U.S. Obviously, that will take some time before it comes into play. But we are -- we expect the whole semicon market to continue to be an upside for us. But as I mentioned also, we also see a lot of interest in the rest of the materials market, particularly in lithium batteries, where we see a lot of demand, not only for our spectroscopy business but really across our broad portfolio where lithium battery needs both the LCs, the GC, the spectroscopies and the CMS.',)\n",
      "(\"Now let's turn to the rest of the P&L. First quarter gross margin was 56.5%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. The gross margin performance, coupled with good cost discipline and SG&A helped drive our operating margin to 27.1%, up 80 basis points from last year. Below the line, our tax rate was 13.75% for the quarter and we had 297 million diluted shares outstanding, both as expected. And putting it all together, earnings per share were $1.37, up 13% from a year ago. In summary, Q1 ended with 10% core top line growth and 13% earnings per share growth, a very good start to the year. Now some metrics on cash flow and our balance sheet. In Q1, we generated $296 million in operating cash flow, up 16% versus last year, while investing $76 million in CapEx. CapEx spending continues to be driven by our scale-up of our Train B manufacturing line and other capacity expansion projects. In the quarter, we returned $142 million to shareholders through $67 million in dividends and by repurchasing shares worth $75 million.\",)\n",
      "(\"What are the variables within China, Mike that you're trying to account for as you forecast the medium term? I mean, maybe beyond just the next couple of months. And I guess any risk that we need to kind of rethink, the underlying growth rate in the industry if China remains light here in the medium term? Yes. So let me start with the view by end market. I think the academia and government market was - grew for us in the third quarter. But everything else was pretty much down. The big change really were in the pharma space. And as Bob commented earlier about how we exited the quarter, the July performance. Some weakness in chemicals, but I'd say the down there was really just a byproduct of - we're going off of 43% compared last year. And we're looking at a 70% growth compare in the fourth quarter. But I'd say the concerns or the cost of this in the China marketplace is really across the board. And with varying degrees, but I think it's really most reflected in the pharma outlook. I think that's a $64,000 question.\",)\n",
      "(\"So we are very excited about that space and see a lot of continued growth there. And Jack, I think the point you made earlier, too, about some of the funding environment, we're seeing some government funding coming in from different parts of the world as part of the semiconductor industry which has benefited us. Great. And then maybe just shifting over more towards pharma biotech. The small molecule grew faster than large molecule this quarter. You've talked in the past about some of that outpaced strength in small molecule being driven from spending related to instrument purchases that were delayed back in 2018, 2019 time frame. Can you walk us through really what inning are we in, in terms of that catch-up spend? And how long can you sustain an outpaced growth in small molecule before it kind of resets back to that normalized level? And then just update on large molecule as well. Sure, Rachel, do I dare pass this question to the Danish member of the staff over that baseball analogy but I think, Jacob, got a great print on LC and LC/MS 17% growth, clearly outpacing the market.\",)\n",
      "('While our full-year growth was lower than initially expected, we met or exceeded every quarterly guidance range we provided, a solid testament to the team’s execution ability. Including FY23 results, our 4-year compound annual growth rate is 7%. This is at the high end of our long-term growth guidance. In FY23, we delivered operating margins of 27.4%. This is up 30 basis points this year and up more than 400 basis points in the last four years. Earnings per share of $5.44 are up 4%, delivering leveraged earnings growth for the year. Our 4-year compound annual growth rate for EPS is 15%. Looking back, 2023 was a challenging year. What I’m particularly proud of is the Agilent team’s ability to quickly pivot and take action to address these challenges while staying relentlessly focused on our customers. While we’ve worked to significantly reduce expenses, Agilent’s customer satisfaction ratings remain at all-time highs. At the same time, our employee engagement continues to be excellent as we achieved a number of best employer awards over the last year. All of this helped us deliver another year of leveraged earnings in an extremely difficult market environment.',)\n",
      "(\"So there's confidence relative to what we see in the funnel. Deals aren't coming out of the funnel. And then although we are focusing here on pharma right now in his commentary, there's a lot of other strength in some of the other secular markets and applied markets, in particular, which is a nice diversification we have on the instrument side as well. And Bob, I don't know if there's any additional thoughts on the pharma story. No. And just one final one. Just what were bookings. I mean, I know you said the book-to-bill was greater than 1, but I'm just curious in terms of bookings. And do you often see a spike in bookings in Q4 Basically, I'm just trying to get the sense of like what you saw as a head fake or you've got -- where you think you've got real demand here? Yes. So we don't give the absolute dollars rather than to say it was greater than 1. It was -- roughly 1 for the total company and then instruments were higher. Typically, we do see a where it is higher.\",)\n",
      "(\"Could you unpack that a little bit for us? Could it perhaps have been due to the fact that you're 1 month later maybe talk about linearity in China through the quarter and if your outlook for the full year. So I think it was high single digits has changed at all. Well, I'm glad you noticed, Brandon and if you were in the conference room here, you see there's a lot of smiling in the room here because really proud of what the team has done here. So I don't think it's all a timing issue. It's about execution and its ability of this team to execute because our teams were hit with waves of COVID during the quarter. But we know how to execute. We've also enabled the -- our ability to interact with customers digitally. So while people maybe couldn't go to the office or couldn't go to customer sites, they were able to support the customers. So we were just -- we were just delighted with the performance out of China in Q3. And Bob, I think it was a broad-based story. We had growth and double-digit growth in pharma, chem, food.\",)\n",
      "(\"But I don't want to be too short-term optimistic about this expansion of growth because the business is bouncing along at a certain level. And that's why we call it stabilization in our prepared remarks. So what we're seeing, what we're forecasting, what we're hearing is from our teams and our customers don't expect any significant near-term improvements but don't expect any significant near-term deterioration either. And I think that's why when you look at the year-to-year numbers in terms of growth rate, Bob, was probably a comp -- payer issue. But we've had a couple of months now just run at a certain level, and that gives us the sense that what -- I think we used were potential signs of stabilization. So I hope that helps. Yes. No, that's helpful color. And then I just want to dig a little bit more on your comments around next year. So you mentioned that you expect the first half to be similar to what you're seeing in the back half of this year. So I guess, can you just walk us through in a little bit more detail what exactly you mean by that?\",)\n",
      "(\"And I think when we look at our performance in those core platforms versus our peers, we're reporting some numbers and kind of adjust for the timing of when we report. I think we're putting up similar kind of numbers. And Jacob, I know you looked at this thing pretty closely and I'm trying to buy some time for Bob to check down the... We're trying to find the CAGR the last three years, which I don't have in front of me here, but you're right Mike, we follow this very accurately. And we're doing - we continue to do very well in this marketplace. We continue to innovate into it. And we have seen - actually, we have taken share over the last period of time. And if you actually compare our calendar two versus competition, would actually see that we are approximately flat in the LC, LCMS space. And I think that stacks up very well versus competition. Yes, hi Brandon, we can get that to you afterwards. Okay.\",)\n",
      "(\"I think there's a case to be made that this market will get back to its longer-term growth rates, but it will take a period of years to get there. It's not going to be a snapback in 12 months. But again, that's work to be done. The factors that we're looking at, I think are the same factors that everybody else is staring at, which is what's going to happen to the macro in China. Storyboard here is a macro story and is bleeding over into life science tools, but we need to see the China economy get moving again. We need to see consumer confidence coming back. We need to see investment commerce is coming back in China. I think those things will take some time. But I do think there are priorities of the government, and they'll find a way to make that happen. But we're not calling for a quick snapback here either. Got it. Appreciate guys. Thank you. We'll go next now to Dan Brennan at TD Cowen. Great guys. Thanks for taking the questions.\",)\n",

Mike and Bob, maybe we'll start on ACG, just given the quarter that it had and the comp it was facing last year, you've talked in the past about areas of underpenetration. I think China was a region you called out. Could you just maybe kind of give us a mark-to-market on where you feel from sort of an end market and regional standpoint, there's still a lot of room for that growth in ACG if we see it continue throughout this year and into next? Yes. Thanks, Matt. First of all, I appreciate the recognition of the numbers we posted and we think there's still a lot more opportunity in front of us. And I want to actually have provide a little bit more color on where those opportunities may lie. Yes.\",)\n",
      "(\"And then maybe just a margin piece. I know you talked a little bit about the second half. And Mike, I think you flagged maybe some additional cost savings in the second half. Can you just talk about, I guess, where you guys are pulling some costs from? How nimble you can be, and how aggressive you want to be as well. Mike, you obviously sound good on the long term. You're kind of dealing with this pullback here. Looks like it's transitory. So how do you think about just the expense management in the near term and that second half margin ramp? Yes. Thanks for the question. I'm really glad to address this head on. So because you hit one of the key messages, we still are very positive on the long-term growth opportunities in these markets we serve. We think we're in a pause in certain segments of our market, but we remain very bullish on the long-term end markets.\",)\n",
      "(\"And what did I see, first of all, I'll just remind how quickly things can happen in China. Electric vehicles everywhere, a lot more green, digital adoption was just amazing. I don't think anybody uses cash there anymore. And then you also remind as you travel around the country, just how big a country is, how big the economy is and how big the markets are for Life Sciences. But to your specific question, here's what I was hearing from customers and my team when I have seen as well, which was why do we think this market eventually will return to growth, all the things that have been driving this market over the years, which is primarily the Chinese government's 14th 5-year plan. They're still on it. They're pointing to long-term growth, improving the quality of life in China. We're hearing stories of new environmental regs coming from PFAS. The anticorruption impacts that we've seen in the health and the pharma space look to may have peaked, with a lot of the actions occurring, which could ultimately long term, lead to more R&D investments because there'll be less money being spent in the SG&A area.\",)\n",
      "('From a group perspective, both ACG and DGG grew, while LSAG unexpectedly declined low single digits as we started to see the accelerated effects of the slowing CapEx environment. Europe grew 5%, in line with expectations led by pharma and CAM. Now moving down the P&L. Second quarter gross margin was 55.3%, down 40 basis points from a year ago, largely due to an unfavorable product mix. The benefit of pricing was as expected. Below gross margin, we had good cost discipline in SG&A, which drove our operating margin to 25.6%, up 30 basis points from last year. Below the line, we benefited from higher-than-planned interest income due to higher interest rates and strong cash flow. Our tax rate was 13.75% for the quarter and we had 297 million diluted shares outstanding, both as expected. Now putting it all together, Q2 earnings per share were $1.27, up 12% from a year ago, a very good result, combined with our 9.5% core topline growth.

Just following up on the LSAG piece. Getting a good amount of inbounds on that. I know you don't want to talk about the book-to-bill, Mike, but just given the level of focus and the visibility here, I know you mentioned the backlog, back down to normal. It seemed like that was adding to it a little bit this quarter. Can you give us a sense on the orders? I mean, were they down double digits? And Bob, maybe just the magnitude of what that decline could look like in 3Q in terms of LSAG revs would be helpful. Yes, sure. We want to give you some additional insights, Bob, so I think you've got some? Yes. So if you looked at our overall orders, they were down low single digits. As Mike mentioned, ACG and DDG grew and LSAG was down mid- to high single digits in the quarter. And as I mentioned before, our guide contemplates a decline for LSAG in both Q3 and Q4. Okay.

I don't know if you caught it in Mike call script, but our sales funnel for instruments are actually growing. So that would say that at some point in time those budgets are going to be released and the orders will close, when I've seen deals come out of - the funnel. We're not seeing order cancellations, we're not seeing changes to our one loss ratio. And we're encouraged by the growth we're seeing in biopharma.

We saw broad resilience in advanced materials with a low single-digit increase year-on-year as well as growth sequentially. Given the extremely tough compare of high 20s growth last year, these are impressive results. As expected, the chemical side saw a decline. The academia and government market was up 2%. The growth in this market reflects the stability of academic funding and lab activity. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market declined 5%, mid-single-digit growth in pathology was more than offset by continued headwinds in genomics, cell analysis and LC and LC/MS.',)\n",
      "(\"And this is -- we've been working on this thing for some time to really build out our portfolio and really change our market position in academia research and I think it's starting to show up in the numbers. I think stabilization really is what we're seeing which is the funding is there. And NIH is a relatively really small part of Agilent's business, so really is immaterial. But we're seeing universities have increasingly been funded through private sector. So the money is there. And even so, we saw money in China as well. So it was really a nice global story for us and we're fairly optimistic that, that kind of stabilization can be there for us for the rest of the year. Your next question will come from the line of Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. I want to ask a question on guidance and then a question on capital deployment. Surely, absolutely. Go ahead, Doug. So for the year, on one hand, around 48% of sales is in the first half, at least that's how you've guided, I believe. Yes, that's lower than last year but it's not outside the norm for the last several years.\",)\n",
      "(\"So there really is no change to that. We think that outside of maybe the chemical side of CAM, those other end markets will hold up relative to our guide expectations. And listen, we've had experience in these cycles before. And Mike, one of the things I wanted to mention earlier to a previous caller's question was, we know when the market is low. This is actually when the Agilent team even shines further. We always gain market share in down markets. So I'm absolutely convinced you heard in my prepared remarks that we're going to come out of this thing stronger. I think the only debate is how long the cycle is going to be. Right, right. Yes. And then kind of to that point, for the fiscal second half, I mean, you're pointing to a 3.5% decline core growth, core sales growth in 3Q, but then it implies roughly flat in 4Q. You touched a little bit on comps at China moving around and things like that. But still sequentially, that's a pretty big reacceleration in the fourth quarter regardless of how you look at it even in absolute dollar terms.\",)\n",
      "(\"And so I would expect us to have the trough of '24 be in Q1, Q2 being a little better and then growing out of that as we benefit from the easier compares. And I would expect our P&L and the EPS to look very similar to that. Q1, we are -- we've taken most of the actions they will have all been taken in the first quarter, but they won't have a full quarter. And so we'll have full quarters of the cost savings in Q2 through Q4. And so as that business kind of improves as the business improves, we'll get more and more leverage on the bottom line. Moving on now to Derik De Bruin at Bank of America. So can we talk a little bit about pharma? That market was up and down all year, not a lot of visibility. Are you seeing some of the orders that were sort of stuck in the funnel starting to come loose, right? I mean, how are you sort of looking at the pharma market going forward? Yes, I think the answer is the deal funnel still remain elongated.\",)\n",
      "(\"We still have a few more months so we finish off the fiscal year, and we'll give you our guide in November. And I think we'll know a lot more by then. But I do think we know that we'll be able to grow this company in '24. That said, I was very careful in my comments to make sure that there's a full year growth rate. We do expect the first half of the year to be a challenging year just from a comp standpoint to begin with, but also some of the things that we've been talking about today in the call, we don't expect a quick snapback to be occurring in the next quarter or 2. Okay. That's helpful. And then I know you mentioned budget flush is still a little bit away from that at the calendar year event for pharma and other areas. Do you have any view at this point? It sounds like you guys are expecting to be a more subdued budget flush, but whatever you're hearing from customers would be helpful just to pull back a little bit more on that.\",)\n",
      "(\"But how do you guys view the recovery in the margins between DGG and LSAG throughout the year to hit your guide? Luke, this is Bob. Just real quick. You're right. If I look at DGG, it actually was improvement year-over-year but it was down and it was really a result of that margin or the volume. I would say also there was an element of mix in LSAG and I would expect that to continue to improve. The cost actions that we took weren't fully actualized all and as expected in Q1. So we'll have the full impact of those as well in Q2 throughout. So I would expect an improvement over the course of the year as volumes grow up in both LSAG and DGG. And then, just a follow-up here from the 2Q guide. Can you just help frame what you guys are embedded there by the different segments?\",)\n",
      "(\"And so with our revised guide, we have ticked it up a bit, given the strong performance that we had in Q1. And we continue to be surprised to the upside. When we talked about it at the beginning of the year, what was a source of upside. This would have been one of the markets that we would have talked about. And what we're seeing is actually good growth across all of the submarkets in our chem market. If I think about the chemical and energy markets, those were up high single digits and the growth was really outsized in that advanced materials that we've been talking about. So that semiconductor in batteries area grew in excess in the high 20s. And so this is a continued strength really given not only the investment there but really the power and strength of our portfolio to be able to supply critical tools and instrumentation into markets that are really continuing to expand. So we're expecting that don't book high single digits and the high 20s for the rest of the quarter, so we'll take it.\",)\n",
      "(\"Yes, it was down close to double digits but not high teens. Okay. And I'm going to have Sam talk about this but we're seeing some what we think is a transitory disruption in the diagnostics side of genomics that there's a lot going on with a lot of the diagnostic firms where we provide our solutions into their assays. So Sam, your perspective on the think would be really good. Yes, happy to provide that. And building on what you said, Mike, right, there's a lot of public information now that I'm sure, Jack, that you're aware of, it restructuring or other sort of operational challenges at a number of customers from research into technology-driven genomics companies and diagnostic testing companies are going through. Based on that, we've definitely seen conservatism from customers that they've pulled back on purchasing levels. They're working down excess safety stock that they perhaps have built up. And we've just seen a little bit of hesitation in purchase patterns. Now that being said, just recently, earlier in February, I had the chance to attend AGBT which is one of the most important technology and science conferences.\",)\n",
      "(\"I think as we're stable -- what we're seeing a stability but no material improvement versus what we saw in the last half of last year. And in terms of the capital budget cycle in '24, this is the time we see it. It's pretty early in that cycle. But we've heard move in both directions, positive and negative but fewer customers expecting negative budgets. So we're watching and seeing how that goes. Yes. I think what you shared with me earlier, Padraig, was the tone was more negative at this time last year. It's still not super positive yet and still a lot of caution but we're not seeing anything to cause us to change our outlook for the year. I think Bob -- thank you very much. I think, Bob, you had one. Yes, I was just going to say one of the things that we see is very strong performance in our services and our consumables business in the pharma sector which actually speaks to lab activity. And so while we've seen a depressed capital cycle here and we're optimistic about that turning around in the second half of the year.\",)\n",
      "(\"You saw both a nice balance here this quarter with about half of it coming through gross margin as well as half of it coming through OpEx. I think as we think about it going forward, I think that 50 to 100 basis points over the course of the next several years is still a reasonable way to think about it. That's how we're thinking about the rest of this year as well. And we'll go next now to Dan Brennan of Cowen. On the quarter -- maybe just the first maybe the first one, another a few questions asked on the Chemical and Advanced Materials segment. But obviously, great growth in the quarter. Just wondering, with your new higher guide for the year, are you assuming something above the mid-single-digit outlook that you previously guided to for the year? And would love if you can give us any color on kind of how the growth broke out this quarter between advanced material and then chemical and energy. Yes. That's -- it's a great question, Dan. I'll take that.\",)\n",
      "(\"But what I would tell you is that we actually started and it's really a late quarter phenomena. We started to see a little bit maybe the last week or so of March, really centered in April, where the level of caution from our customers increased. Deal cycles were continuing to get further pushed out, deals weren't closing. And that really was the reason for the push in terms of downward guide for the second half. What I can tell you, what we're seeing so far through May, I think that was also one of your questions, is mid-May today orders, if you will, are tracking towards our revised order expectation. We haven't -- we've been through these cycles before in terms of downturns. These are always hard to predict because it's always hard to know exactly when the cycle started. But our experience is at least 12-month kind of cycles, 12 to 18 months. So -- and I think that's really the question that we need to work through here in the next few quarters. And again, as Bob and I have said in the past, we take one quarter at a time.\",)\n",
      "(\"We continue to see strong demand for our services as we help customers drive productivity in the lab. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenues of $349 million, up 3% core. Pathology grew high single digits as demand for our diagnostic test continues to grow. Our NASD business grew high teens. This growth was partially offset as we are continuing to see market weakness for our Genomics and Resolution Bioscience businesses. Regarding resolution Bioscience, the market for kidded NGS-based companion diagnostics has not developed as we expected. Furthermore, we don't see a realistic path to profitability. As a result, we've made a difficult decision to shut down the business. However, our investments in future growth continue. For example, we achieved an important milestone during the quarter when our NASD business generated the first revenues from our Train B investment in Frederick, Colorado. Now looking forward for the company, as we navigate this challenging macroeconomic environment, we remain confident in the Agilent team and our ability to continue driving leverage earnings growth, use our agile Agilent framework. We faced challenges before, and we're taking actions now that will make us stronger and position us well for the future.\",)\n",
      "(\"We continue to feel very good about our portfolio, and continue to drive that growth. In regards to pricing across the board, we were slightly better than what we had expected. It was roughly over - a little over 4% for the quarter. And that was driven across all three of the groups. So we continue to drive - positive price across not only our DGG and ACG business, but also our instrumentation and that's globally. And we expect to be able to continue to demonstrate the value of our instrumentation across the globe. Obviously, in a deflationary environment, that will put a little more pressure on the instrumentation business, particularly in China but we've incorporated that into, our forecast and are still on track for positive price contributions, for the full year in excess of 3%. Hi Bob, maybe Bob or Padraig and also going to maybe comment on some discounting trends he may have been seeing? Yes. No, I think - no, I think it's the pricing holds discounts has really held stable as well. We haven't seen any - increase in that rate of it, and we continue to monitor that, but it's been very stable, Mike.\",)\n",
      "(\"And Bob, maybe you can elaborate on that? That's right. Thanks, Mike. And as you said, our NGS QC portfolio from an instrument and consumable side actually grew mid-single digits in the quarter which was very nice. The genomics chemistry side that we referenced in the prepared remarks was down. We faced some very difficult comps. We had a couple of companies that reorganized and exited some businesses. They had some lifetime buys at the end of Q1. I would expect that the performance of that to improve starting in the second half of the year. Great. And I also wanted to ask about the academic end market. I know that's been very stable for you guys. But just what you're seeing in the U.S. here with the continuing resolution for the NIH, just thoughts on the durability moving forward. Yes, Jack, thanks for noticing that. That was a real bright spot for us. We actually grew, I think, 2% in the quarter.\",)\n",
      "(\"We'll get back to focusing on its long-term goals of making China an innovation driven economy, which will require continued investments in R&D. It's going to also get back to focusing on improving the health of - the population, addressing some of environment issue, so we think it's getting back to fundamentals. Yes, we think that eventually will occur, but there's a lot of issues that we may be work through within the China right now. But - it's a very large market, the market is not going to disappear. And I think there'll be investments. I think there's also needs to be a level of confidence in the private sector in China, that it's a good time to reinvest and maybe I shouldn't wait on the sidelines hope for its stimulus, but get back to work and get my business going. So there's a lot of dynamics. I really have to say though, I don't know if I have a comparable situation that we've been through for this long. I think Bob and I were talking earlier today.\",)\n",
      "(\"And then -- and maybe just one on NASD since you brought it up. Another terrific quarter. Can you just unpack a little bit on kind of what the funnel looks like there? Is the same level of growth kind of persist in the second half? And now that you're bringing on -- kind of working on the new Train, kind of what's the durability of that growth as you look out beyond year-end? Of course, you will take that one. Yes, super pleased with the performance of NASD. And as we look out to the second half of the year, we feel good about the performance and are excited about Train B coming online. And we're having conversations with customers as we look to fill that Train up. And what I would say is kind of stay tuned from that standpoint. But what I would say long term, we're extremely excited about this. That's why we're investing another $700 million in adding Train C and D as well.\",)\n",
      "(\"Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Maybe just going to beat the dead horse but just for the instruments, did you guys say -- I know in the Q, you usually put out what the instrument number actually was. So what did actually instruments do in the quarter? And then given how much easier comps go as we get through the year? Can you just kind of give us a sense of pacing like what should we expect on Q2 in instruments and then we can kind of have at the back half of the year? I know the team did a calculation on that because LSAG was down 11% but that includes our consumables business which was up. Yes, I would say we typically don't give all that information but it was down -- we were down 11%. It was down, puts 20%, in the quarter but that was better than expected, offset by 6% growth in our consumables business. If we look at the LSAG thinking for Q2, it's down low teens.\",)\n",
      "(\"So can you talk to us about how much of your China exposure is really tied to those small molecule workflows? And then what else is really driving incremental weakness on the small molecule side? We've heard of IRA pressuring some pharma decisions and potentially leading to them reprioritizing the pipeline. So is there any risk that you won't see a recovery? Or could the growth rate for small molecule really be reset in? What are your conversations with customers on that trend? Thank you. Okay. So you got it. So relative to China, I would say it's probably the same ratio as the global business, right? That's probably what 60%, 65%? Yes. Is probably related to a small molecule. And relative to what's happened in large pharma, what we're seeing is in medium-sized pharma is, again, a continuation of this cautious about deferring capital. I'm sure they're thinking through implications of iRNA also other expenses are running hotter in their P&Ls where they need to make some offsets with capital purchases. That being said, if you believe, and I know pharma believes the importance of having safe on-market drugs.\",)\n",
      "(\"And as you know, coming probably at least for the last 12 to 18 months, we had been indicating that we were expecting to see a slowdown in the rate of replacement. And in fact, we've seen that occur this year. Actually, given the weakness in China even beyond our expectations with a minus 16% number overall in the quarter. That being said, we do stay with our view that these tend to be 18 to 24 months, 12 to 18-month cycles, and we'd expect that they'll start to see movement back towards a higher growth rate. And that's one of the reasons as we look into '24, we're saying some of these markets will start to turn as - the base cycle gets back to more of a growth phase in that cycle. And as we've mentioned earlier, we see that particularly in liquid chromatography is probably about a five percentage kind of growth market long-term. Great. Thank you for all that color. Maybe just following up on your small molecule comments there. So small molecule declined 16% this quarter.\",)\n",
      "(\"Bob, with 65% of your business being a service contracts, could you elaborate on what sort of growth contribution we should expect here for full year? And also, I don't know if you provided the LSAG expectation contribution for 2024 as well? Yes. For ACG, we're expecting kind of mid-single-digit growth as we are -- with the contracted services piece being double digit, but then being pressured by the instrumentation. So that will be moderated. And for the LSAG business, right now, we're looking at kind of low single-digit decline. Again, with a greater decline in the first half of the year and the return to better performance in the second half of the year. Got it. Okay. And then on -- if I could ask a little bit on am I onshoring that's point that you're pointing -- that's not something we are focused on in prior calls. And I hear you that you're growing on the PFAS side, but just wondered -- could you elaborate a little bit on both some onshoring as well as the environmental gains that you're having? And why shouldn't that contribute more to your instrumentation growth in 2024. Yes.\",)\n",
      "(\"And then I think we all believe in the view that NGS will continue to be a growth market for us. And for the industry, I think that people are dying on back their expectations about how robust it is for a period of time. And I think we're seeing that in our business. So why do we make some of the structure changes we made in the portfolio because we want to ensure that we've got the ability to have a healthy P&L while at the same point in time invest in growth. So there's a reallocation of R&D dollars happening as a result of some of the changes we made that we talked about over the call. So answer the story is we have a lot of appetite for focused investments in areas where we think we can win in genomics.\",)\n",
      "(\"So are you assuming any reaccel in the 4Q? Are you -- any indication of that happening in terms of orders? I guess, just why is it really fiscal 3Q that's being hammered here? Yes. I mean, we typically do have some seasonality built into our results. If you not just looked at last year, but historically, our Q4 does have a typical ramp-up from Q3. And we're looking at it. If you look historically kind of how we're looking at the seasonality, that's kind of how we built it in. We are expecting stronger both revenue and order performance, Q4 relative to Q3, based on what we know today. Okay, all right, thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Great, thanks. Thanks guys for the questions. Mike and Bob, maybe just a question just kind of clarifying some of the numbers here on emerging biopharma. What did that business do in the quarter itself? I don't think I caught that. I know, Bob, you said it's going to decline as part of your guidance.\",)\n",
      "(\"But the timeline, as Bob mentioned, are extended, and we're often here -- often at higher levels of approval as well within our customer base. That's helpful. Lastly, if you could unpack kind of what you're seeing in Europe. Overnight, we got pretty weak manufacturing PMIs. I was just curious if you see any slowdown in terms of the more cyclical, let's say, industrial odds in the geography. Yes. Sure, Brandon. No, you may recall earlier this year, we really were pointing to Europe as a watch area, particularly Western Europe. I have to say, we continue to point to it as a watch area, but we've been pleased with the results to date. We are seeing signs of increased cautiousness on the chemical side of our customer base in Europe, but advanced materials continues to be -- demand there. And we're pleased with how the business is holding up right now. Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Sure. Mike, can you just frame sort of what April trends were?\",)\n",
      "(\"This would be - we have deferred projects being very rational, really focused on revenue-generating programs. And so, I do expect some of that will flow into '24, but I don't expect '24 to have an incremental $200 million show up in the forecast. Got it. Thank you. We'll go next now to Puneet Souda at Leerink Partners. Hi Mike, Bob. Thanks for taking the questions. Sure. The first one, thanks. So maybe, Bob, could you elaborate a bit on pricing here? I know pricing was a meaningful contributor initially this year. We're seeing China, obviously, you talked quite a bit about it, and we're seeing the headline for China deflation. So wondering if you are expecting pricing to maintain there, or do you expect pricing pressure in China continuing? And also, we're seeing some of the peer sort of bioprocessing companies talking about local competition rising on the less high tech product. And so wondering if you're seeing that on any of - sort of your product lines as well? Yes. Let me take the second question first. We can compete against the Chinese local competitors each and every day. And nothing has changed from that standpoint.\",)\n",

Currency was a 0.5 point headwind while M&A contribution was minimal. As you may recall, Q3 of last year benefited from roughly $35 million in revenue deferred from the second quarter as we ramp back up from the Shanghai shutdown in China. Accounting for this, our Q3 core growth would be roughly flat versus a year ago. As Mike mentioned, Pharma, our largest end market, declined 8%. This is in line with our reduced expectations coming out of Q2 with underperformance in China, offset by better performance in the rest of the world. The Chemicals and Advanced Materials market was down 3% off a very tough 22% compare, but dollar-wise was flat sequentially. The academia and government market was up 5% and with all regions showing growth except the Americas, which was flat. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 3%, driven by high single-digit growth in pathology, partially offset by genomics weakness. The environmental and forensics business grew 2%, driven by double-digit growth in the Americas and Europe.',)\n",
      "(\"Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I thought maybe I'd start just with China, sort of a high-level question. You guys talked about sort of the transitory impact of the current environment. You mentioned pharma. Could you kind of extend those comments to China? Do you think it's more cyclical versus structural? Are there competitive issues that you're facing or just your outlook on that region? Thanks. Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. So let me start with the last part of your question. This is a macro story, not a competitive story. So market shares continue to be very, very strong. I know there's a lot of discussion about increased local competition, but we've moved pretty aggressively on our made in China strategy. So we don't see that all as a competitive issue. Transitory, the comment there is really about the fact that the China market is not going away. It's going to be a big market for years to come. It clearly is challenged right now. And we're not -- we're taking a sort of one quarter at a time, actually month by month.\",)\n",

I think if -- I'll try to answer all that in short order, Rachel. As we think about the first half of the year, yes, we think that we -- as we look at our business and look at that kind of book-to-bill, we've kind of troughed in Q2. Q3, I think we mentioned actually was a little better. It was less than -- still less than 1 and then Q4 continue to improve. And our expectation is that, that kind of performance will continue. Now we're going up against difficult comps when we were actually bleeding down our inventory. And that particularly happened in Q1 and Q2 of last year as we were talking about it.\",)\n",

It was a difficult decision to retire after almost 40 great years with this special company and in the role that I love, I will miss working with the One Agilent team. However, I must say it's a great feeling and quite gratifying to be handing over the CEO reins to a tremendously capable successor in Padraig. With Agilent operating from a position of strength and with a very promising long-term outlook. I have known Padraig for more than 20 years. I've worked closely with him during that time.

      "('In the Americas, revenue was down 8% due to declines in pharma and the softness in NASD and NGS chemistries. Moving down the P&L. First quarter gross margin was 56.0% down 50 basis points from a year ago as productivity and cost savings were offset by lower demand and mix. Our operating margin of 25.8% was down year-over-year as expected. Our ongoing cost savings initiatives are delivering as planned. Below the line, we benefited from greater-than-expected interest income in the quarter, driven by nice work from our treasury team, coupled with very strong cash flow. Our tax rate was 13.5% and we had 294 million diluted shares outstanding. Putting it all together, Q1 earnings per share were $1.29, down 6% from a year ago and ahead of our expectations. Now, let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. I continue to be very pleased with our cash flow generation. Operating cash flow was $485 million in the quarter, significantly above last year. In Q1, we invested $90 million in capital expenditures as we continue our planned NASD expansion. And during the quarter, we returned $69 million to shareholders through dividends.',)\n",

So that happens, then it would be -- that would be a nice thing for all of us. Yes, absolutely, Bob. That's helpful. Bob. And maybe, Bob, just on the margin side, helpful to hear you talk through a few of the different moving pieces. It sounds like some cost savings in DGG, among others. I guess can you just give a bit more color on kind of the moving pieces, where you're pulling levers, the ability to take out some additional costs to hit these margin numbers. Obviously, you talked about margins being up a bit. I think there are some headwinds like incentive comp, things like that.\",)\n",

The DGG team continues to innovate and deliver differentiated solutions for our customers. In the quarter, we induced a new ProteoAnalyzer system. The new platform simplifies and improves the efficiency of analyzing complex protein mixtures. And processes that are central to analytical workflows across the pharma, biotech, food analysis and academia sectors.

In fact, we've seen the opposite where sometimes orders that we thought were closed to actually keep deferring and require more purchases. In fact, I think one story we heard was we probably 3x. Fondo CFO, approved it on the third go-around and the CEO overruled it. So we know eventually going to get that business. But this is kind of dynamics ever seen. So we're not seeing a lot of indications of a strong year-end budget flush. Again, we'd love to see the opposite happen, but we're not going to indication of that.

I mean valuations have obviously come in, industry is consolidating, you would say, but we have -- it's been relatively quiet across the space for the last 18 months. And so like how are you sort of thinking about capital deployment? And at what point do you decide you maybe want to buy -- start maybe doing even with the share prices, maybe doing some share buybacks. You sort of talk about your general capital deployment strategy at this moment? Yes.\",)\n",
      "(\"Last year's growth was helped by the benefit of recovery from the Q2 2022 Shanghai shutdown. LSAG's performance continues to be affected by the market environment in China across all end markets and pharma globally. Our sales funnel remains healthy and are up year-on-year, but deal velocity continues to slow as customers remain cautious in making capital purchases. We expect this market environment for new instrument purchases to continue for the rest of the year. At this time, we are not assuming any benefit from a year-end budget flush or incremental stimulus in China. As we said before, we are continuing to prioritize invest in innovation. As an example, in June, Agilent's investment innovation were on full display at the Annual ASMS Conference. The LSAG team introduced new products and comprehensive workflows to enhance data quality and productivity for our customers. These include two new LC/MS systems, a new PFAS workflow solution and an AI software for data analysis, among others. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenues of $396 million. This is up an impressive 11% core with growth in all regions and end markets, as customers continue to embrace our value proposition.\",)\n",
      "(\"Can you maybe talk about sort of where you see the durability of that growth is sort of high single, low double, 30%-plus margins, how we should be thinking about the business? Or were there some one-offs in the quarter that you'd want to call out to kind of measure expectations there? Yes. We've consistently communicated that we think this is a high single digit, low double-digit kind of growth business for us. It's been that way since pretty much most of my tenure as CEO, and we don't see that changing as we go forward. Of course, there'll be puts and takes by quarter. But we're continuing to see good growth in our connect rates, which we've talked a lot about. And we're also doing very well on winning the enterprise business as well to complement the other aspects of our portfolio offerings. I would say that the profitability was probably a little bit higher in Q3 than - but we do think that the high double-digit number you quote about is pretty manageable for that business, but not at the level we saw in Q3, right, Bob? Yes. Matt, this is Bob.\",)\n",
      "('In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter and the year, as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I’ll then finish up with our guidance for fiscal year 2024 and the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Agilent finished the fourth quarter with core growth at the top end of guidance and EPS exceeding our expectations as we executed well against challenging macroeconomic conditions. Q4 revenue was $1.69 billion, down 9.7% core and 8.7% on a reported basis. This is after growing 17.5% in Q4 last year, when we benefitted from the recovery from the Shanghai shutdown in Q2 of last year. This created an estimated 1 point of headwind in the year-on-year results this quarter. As expected, we saw weakness in capital purchases in LSAG with the biggest impact in our China business. Now, I’d like to share additional detail on our end markets for the quarter. Revenue in our largest market pharma, declined 14%, versus 20% growth in Q4 last year. BioPharma declined 2% while small molecule was down 23%.',)\n",
      "(\"I think I think one thing is really clear that the funnels are very strong, and it's there, but we're not seeing them to be released through a big push at the end of the year. I think this comment, Patrick, on the funnel being strong and these funnels are actually growing is really important because this is one of the reasons why we think about full year outlook in '24. We know the business is there. It's just a question of when it's going to get -  Yes. We watch very closely our win loss rates. And we haven't - we've seen them very, very stable -- we had a strong funnel, which is very positive over time. Understood. Thank you, guys. We'll go next now to Derik De Bruin at Bank of America. Hi. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Derik. A lot of what I wanted to ask has been asked, so I've got some cleanups here. Just did you give a specific instrument core growth number in consumables growth or number for 3Q and then sort of your all-in number for this year, what you're expecting? Yes. We didn't. LSAG for Q3 was down roughly 9% core.\",)\n",

We continue to see really good interest in our Magnus automation system which is the walk away for our SureSelect platform and our broad-based market leadership and genomics and NGS QC remains intact. So I think this is some market headwinds that we're seeing but it's just, I think, a transitory thing, as Mike mentioned. We take our next question now from Josh Waldman of Cleveland Research. For you -- two for you, if I may. First, on the core growth guide, I wondered if you could provide a bit more color on the considerations that went into reiterating the top end of the core growth outlook for the year. I guess, maybe a bit surprised, we didn't see more of the Q1 upside flow through to the full year. I'm wondering if maybe this is backlog work down benefit here in the quarter that starts to abate as we get into the second half for some, I guess, something else? Yes.\",)\n",
      "(\"Agilent has a compelling story to tell and I'm excited by the possibilities that lie in front of us as we help our customers bring great signs to life. Thanks, Padraig. For today's call, I will take lead, covering the overview of our financial results, while next quarter, Padraig will take on these duties as the new CEO. Now, on to the Q1 results. We are pleased with the start of the year. The Agilent team continues its strong execution in a challenging market environment. The first quarter provided further evidence of our team's capabilities with revenue coming in better than expected at $1.66 billion. This represents a decline of 6.4% against a tough compare of 10% growth in Q1 of last year. The better-than-expected top line results and disciplined cost management drove higher-than-expected earnings per share of $1.29 down 6% from Q1 last year. Given the solid Q1 results and our continued view is slow but steady recovery throughout the year, we are maintaining our full year outlook that we shared with you in November. Key to our Q1 performance was the ongoing sequential stabilization we experienced in China and secular growth drivers in applied markets globally.\",)\n",

Today marks my 37th and final earnings call with all of you. Time does truly fly by. I want to first thank you for your support and engagement over the years. I have to say it has been a tremendous honor serving as Agilent's CEO and represent the achievements of the One Agilent team to all of you and the broader investor community. In 2015, we launched the then new Agilent with a goal to transform Agilent into a leading life science and diagnostics company. We had ambitious goals to drive long-term shareholder value creation with significantly stepped up financial results delivered by an unmatched One Agilent team working together in a truly differentiated and compelling company culture. I couldn't be proud of the Agilent team and what we've accomplished together over the last 9 years.\",)\n",
      "(\"Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik. Just following up on the previous point on pharma -- big pharma slowing down. You used a lot of comments in a slower deal velocity taking longer to close the deals, et cetera. But as you just said, you're not seeing an obvious catalyst. Is there any risk you're going to see slower deal velocity elsewhere as you go through the year? I mean, academic and government, applied materials, these are sectors that also had, I would say, above trend growth in recent years and in the fiscal first half. So -- but you're not building in any conservatism in those areas for the rest of the year. So how would you characterize the risk there just given how quickly pharma turned? Sure. Bob and I think we've got a realistic forecast here. And that's why we're asking to think about guidance in the midpoint. We had already assumed some level of slower capital investment in those end markets in our previous guide.\",)\n",
      "('I remain convinced China will continue to play an important role in life sciences and I’m confident that the China market will return to growth. In looking at our largest end market, pharma declined 14% driven by continued caution among customers on capital expenditures for new instruments. Within pharma, biopharma performed better than small molecule. Geographically, our biopharma business outside of China grew high-single digits. Looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered revenue of $928 million, down 18% core versus a tough compare last year of up 22%. Customers continue to hold off on capital expenditures, particularly in the pharma segment of LSAG’s business, which declined in the high 20% range. This is against growth in the low 20s last year. On the other hand, we continue to see strong customer demand and growth in our PFAS solutions, as well as continued strength in the advanced materials segment. These are two secular trends we’ve highlighted before and we remain optimistic about future growth in these market segments. While the market environment remains challenged, we continue to innovate and provide unique solutions for our customers.',)\n",
      "(\"And as both Mike and Bob was talking about, these markets are changing right now. So while we will see a change in the market dynamics and thereby also some of the growth rates, the strategy have been in place from LCMS and pretty much the whole portfolio has been to build these workflows that is based on robust reliable instruments and really solution-oriented. And we expect and we see that this is what our customers are looking for. And hence, I'm expecting that while the markets are down, we will continue to see market share gain in this business and also in the LCMS business. Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you. Going back to the, Mike, so your comment on large pharma, mid and large pharma, the 90% of the business is not the emerging biotech within your reported pharma segment. Do you have any sense or any theory from your field team on why that customer base has gotten more cautious and why deal cycles have lengthened?\",)\n",
      "(\"And I think along what Padraig mentioned is that there's been a lot of investment from both the businesses and in commercial about driving connect rate also with consumables. And it's more about selling the full solution and hence, going out not only present an instrument but percent, the instrument is the consumables, informatics to go after as Padraig was mentioning, PFAS, other workflows in the biopharmas and really addressing -- we're starting to addressing the high-end parts of the market. And we've seen a significant uptake in our attach rates in our consumables and -- and I would say we are -- we will continue to see growth. We still have a long -- a lot of opportunities but I've been really impressed with the team to take it from the 20s up way beyond the 30s now. We'll go next now to Paul Knight of KeyBanc. On the RNA or the oligo production business, it looks like we've had, I guess, 4 or 5 here in the last 4 years or so dominated by Alnylam and Novartis. I'm assuming that this customer count you talk to and project count is expanding well beyond that group of that customer.\",)\n",
      "(\"Great. Maybe just on China. I know you mentioned, I think, in the prepared remarks like month-to-month pacing had improved in the quarter. Just any more color or anything on exit rates in China. And if you could, I'd be entered to get like some more color on the end market trends in China. I know you gave some color on biopharma, but could you discuss pharma overall and any other interesting color from an end market basis? Sure. Bob, maybe we'll tag team on this, which was -- I think the -- relative to the order book, I think we were slightly above revenue for the quarter. No really unusual pacing through the quarter from China. We've been calling -- I know a lot of our conversation today has been about pharma, but we've been saying for some quarters overall for China, it's been a broad-based slowdown. And that's what the business has been, and that's how we ended the year in terms of the end market performance. I will say that we were pleased that we were in line with our expectations for the business.\",)\n",
      "('In Q4, we generated operating cash flow of $516 million, well over 100% of adjusted net income, and invested $84 million in capital expenditures. CapEx spending is driven by our ongoing NASD capacity expansion, which remains on track. For the year, we delivered $1.5 billion in free cash flow, an increase of 44% over last year. Our balance sheet continues to remain healthy as we end the fiscal year with a net leverage ratio of 0.6 times. With the current challenges in the market, it is great to be a company with a fortress balance sheet and strong cash flow. In the quarter, we paid out $66 million in dividends and spent $80 million to repurchase shares. And for the year, we returned $840 million to shareholders through $265 million in dividends and $575 million in share repurchases. Looking forward, you may have also seen that we recently announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend providing another source of value to our shareholders. It’s worth noting that we have increased our dividend every year since we first began issuing them in 2012. Now, let’s move on to our outlook for the upcoming fiscal year and first quarter.',)\n",
      "(\"I'll then finish up with our updated guidance for the year and our third quarter outlook. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Q2 revenue was $1.72 billion, exceeding our expectations. Revenues were up 9.5% core and up 6.8% on a reported basis. Currency was a 2.8 point headwind, while the M&A contribution was minor as expected. In Q2, we continued to leverage our backlog and exited the quarter with our backlog at a normalized level. As Mike mentioned, our two largest end markets performed well in the quarter. Pharma, our largest end market, posted 6% growth led by biopharma, while small molecule declined slightly. Chemicals and advanced materials continued to drive strong secular growth of 16% during the quarter on top of 9% growth last year. The chemical and energy subsegments of the market are doing well, with the advanced materials market continuing to lead the way. As in past quarters, semiconductors and batteries are driving demand in this space. And looking at the rest of the end markets, the food market grew an impressive 21% during the quarter driven by very strong growth in China.\",)\n",
      "(\"Bob, I'll let -- I think the headline is more just the recognition of the continued uncertainty about the back half but... Yes, I think the way to think about that, Josh, is we raised the midpoint of the guidance delivered 10% in Q1. We're saying that Q2 is going to be higher than the full year. And we're going to take this 1 quarter at a time, given some of the uncertainty that we're seeing. Obviously, we did talk about having great visibility into Q1 with some of the backlog activities and so forth. But I wouldn't say it was just that. I mean, I think what I would characterize it as a prudent guide given kind of what we're seeing and taking it 1 quarter at a time. Got it. Okay. And then, Mike, following up on pharma, I think these accounts typically start to get better clarity on their full year budgets this time of year. Wondered if you could update us on what you're hearing from key pharma accounts with respect to instrument budgets and purchasing plans here in '23? Yes. Sure, Josh.\",)\n",
      "(\"We also saw strong results in the Americas and in Europe. The academia and government market was up 11%, led by China and Europe as the funding environment continues to be constructive. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 6% on top of 5% growth last year. Pathology again led the way for us here, partially offset by genomics. And the environmental and forensics business grew 2%, led by China and the Americas, while Europe declined. The Americas slowed after a very strong Q1, but still delivered mid-single-digit growth. On a geographic basis, the China team exceeded our expectations, delivering 32% growth following last year's COVID lockdowns in Shanghai. As we mentioned last year, the COVID-related lockdowns deferred roughly $55 million in Q2 from last year into third and fourth quarters. So while Q2 is an easier compare, we will have much tougher compares in China going forward. Taking out the effects of the lockdown this quarter, we estimate China still grew double digits, so very solid results by our China team. And the rest of Asia grew high single digits, better than expected. The Americas grew 3% with growth across all end markets.\",)\n",
      "(\"So we've taken a look at our real estate footprint and have actually closed several smaller sites between -- around the world really. And then the final piece is really kind of infrastructure optimization, which would be discretionary spend but then also headcount reductions that would be focused on areas where we've rightsized it to the demand. And Patrick, this is Mike, I stated about the confidence about the growth recovery. I think when it comes to hitting the $175 million, high degree of confidence, we control this 100%, and we'll deliver on this. We'll go next now to Matt Sykes at Goldman Sachs. Maybe just on NASD, I noticed just over the past, call it 1.5 years, we've kind of gone from high double digits, low double digits next year, mid-single digits, which it's probably just some level of normalization as you ramp capacity. But just given the step up in CapEx you're guiding to next year, is there some wiggle room in terms of how you guys lay that capacity out? Or is the confidence in that market growth enough to keep investing in that area next year? I'll jump right into that one.\",)\n",
      "(\"And then just a high-level question, or a simple question. Could you maybe elaborate a bit on the pharma side, where you're seeing more traction, more growth? Is it the large pharma, small biotechs, CROs, CDMOs. Maybe just talk a little bit about that. Yes, I'll take that, Puneet. If we look at across our business, the relative strength was actually in our biopharma. So a large molecule. And our business is skewed to the larger midsize and large cap companies. The standout has been the ACG business and our consumables on that. So it actually speaks to activity in the labs. We are starting to see -- I don't want to call it a trend but certainly a stabilization on the emerging biotech side of it. The instruments were still down but that is where we're starting to see the relative strength in the pharma business. And that speaks to kind of the long-term growth drivers, I think, in that market. And I would expect that to continue throughout the course of the year as our business gets stronger and the markets get stronger. And quite honestly, we have more favorable comps.\",)\n",
      "(\"In addition to revising our guidance, we've increased the guidance range for the second half of the year to reflect a wider range of possible outcomes. For modeling purposes, I would encourage you to use the midpoint of our guide. Our updated guidance reflects a more constrained capital market, primarily impacting our instrument business. The outlook for our recurring revenue businesses remains largely unchanged. From an end market perspective, the market most impacted is pharma where we are now expecting full year growth of low single digits, down from high single digits. And from a geographic perspective, we see impacts focused in the U.S. and China. With the change in revenue, we now expect full year fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $5.60 and $5.65, representing growth of 7% to 8%. As with revenue, I encourage you to model at the midpoint of our guidance. Now turning to Q3. We expect revenue in the range of $1.64 billion to $1.675 billion. This represents a decline of 4.5% to a decline of 2.5% for both reported and core revenue. This is on top of a tough compare of 13% growth last year.\",)\n",

In his short time in the role, we’ve already seen Phil add tremendous value as a member of our senior leadership team. Welcome, Phil. Now onto our fourth quarter results. The Agilent team once again continued to perform well under challenging market conditions. Revenue of $1.69 billion declined 9.7% core after increasing 17.5% last year. This is at the high end of our guidance. Our proactive approach to managing our cost structure in this market environment helped us deliver healthy fourth quarter operating margins of 27.8%. Q4 earnings per share of $1.38 exceeded our guidance. While this was a decline of 10%, it comes against a tough compare last year when EPS grew 26%. While the market continues to be challenging, we believe we are starting to see signs of stabilization.\",)\n",
      "(\"So look, I think the broad product offering across the hardware platforms where we've had a value to -- where we add a lot of value to customer operations has been broad-based. We certainly see a lot of our offerings, particularly around asset utilization and so on, being able to be used outside pharma in different industries and we see that as an opportunity to grow. I think also given our big installed base and our ability to attach in different markets and sectors is going to continue as we go through the year. Yes, I think we see a lot of opportunity, obviously, in China. That's when we flagged in the past. The other one that we're pointing to is a lot of the growth has historically been centered in the pharma space. We're seeing growing interest in the CAM space as well. So I think from an end market perspective, that's an area we would expect to see some more growth. And geographically, the China story still hasn't fully played out yet.\",)\n",

But I wouldn't say anything has materially changed since the beginning of the year from that standpoint. And I've been very pleased with our ability to continue to maintain that pricing throughout the course of the last several quarters and I would expect that to continue going forward. Okay. That's helpful. And then on the Lunar New Year, is that part of -- is that baked into the guide as well? And I just wanted to clarify on China. I mean obviously, you have heard about the stimulus, your -- actually Agilent is listed -- one of the companies listed within the document that was put out for the loan stimulus for China. This is sizable. How are you thinking about it? You obviously have the longest and one of the most legacy positions in China.

So first up on semiconductors, one of your peers have flagged that they were expecting the semiconductor market to be soft throughout 2023, just as semiconductors or semi customers were facing a reset just given a macro environment. So you mentioned strength in semi-dry prepared. So can you just walk us through, first off which part of the market do you guys really play in, in semis? And then are you seeing any of the softness that one of your peers have flagged? Yes, I'll start and then we'll turn it over to Jacob to give some additional color about where we play and so forth. But I would say the short answer is no. I mean, our spectroscopy business grew over 20% in the quarter and we're still seeing strong demand. And Jacob, you want to provide a little more color? Yes, absolutely. We have -- I would say we have the strongest portfolio in atomic recopy for this market in semi but generally speaking, in material science.\",)\n",

The first one was, could you just talk about what you're seeing in the genomics business within DGG. I know it's still been a bit of a drag. Just when do you think that's going to start to turn? I think I'll invite Bob in on this one but I think it's been sort of a tale of two cities. When we talk about our genomics business, there's really two pieces to it. The half of it's in QA/QC activities for NGS workflows and we're seeing really solid growth in the consumables on that side of things as well as you're starting to see signs of life on the CapEx, not the current because the call churn there yet but that's in a reasonably good shape.

So we've heard some varying comments on this market. So can you just walk us through what are you exactly seeing? And what do you expect for the full year for LC growth?

So can you just talk to us about share gains and kind of what parts of the market, whether that's geographic basis or customer segment wise, that you're doing in LC?

      "(\"The change in the food ministry, a number of years ago is - was the biggest thing we've seen or 24 plus seven some of the biggest things we've seen a change, but this is much more of a macro economic issue in China, which is different than what we've seen before. Obviously, we have an impact on life sciences tool, but it's a much bigger macro story is really driving the softness right now in our markets. Yes. The only thing I would say, Dan to build on what Mike was saying is, as he mentioned, the demographics are with us when you think about the aging population, the need to actually access healthcare more important therapeutics, and the importance of ensuring the water and food supply. They are the world's leaders today in electric and clean energy. It's hard to believe when everyone thinks about that. But they are the leader, and they have more electric cars than any other region.

I think the standouts for us were actually the chem markets along with diagnostics. But I have to say we continue to watch closely the investment plans particularly for our large accounts in the chemical space as well as pharma space. But we're off to a really good start but that's -- that remains a watch area for us. But again, we're delighted with the broad-based growth we had. And I don't know if you...

While declining overall against a very strong Q1 of last year, our applied end markets were more resilient than expected and show sequential growth from the fourth quarter. In these markets, PFAS Solutions and Advanced Materials, including batteries and semiconductors were high bits for us. Geographically, both China and Europe finished Q1 better than expected, while revenue for the Americas was in line with expectations. Looking at performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered revenues of $846 million and down 11%. This is against a difficult compare of 10% growth last year. While still too early to call an overall market recovery, results were better than expected. Our diversified portfolio and broad end market coverage helped drive the performance. We continue to experience a conservative environment for capital spending. But are better than expected, Q1 results were driven by consumables which grew mid-single digits, China and a better-than-expected performance in applied markets.',)\n",
      "(\"I don't want to kind of parse it out to give you a percent, but that kind of at least gives you kind of how we were thinking about the Q1 guide relative to what we saw in Q1 of last year. Appreciate that. And then as a follow-up, can you remind me in 2024, when do we lap the headwinds on the genomics side? And what is your appetite continued investment in genomics as part of the DGG portfolio. Yes, I would expect us to -- we will have a difficult Q1 and then starting to get better from Q2 and beyond, not dissimilar from the rest of some of the businesses. And then I'll let Mike talk about the kind of the investment. Yes, I think first of all, just to remind the audience, when we talk about the genomics mix business, what are we talking about? We got a $500 million business, probably 50% of it is in QA/QC instrumentation, where we are the undisputed leader here, a lot of appetite to invest here. Our TapeStation product, particularly the consumables business is on fire right now. Capital side is constrained as we've seen across the marketplace.\",)\n",

      "(\"Quality backlog remains high, no significant order cancellations and as Padraig likes to say, we're adding fresh funnel to the backlog. So it points to future demand, but we're just not seeing indications of when their buying behaviors are going to change. All right, thanks. Thanks guys. I appreciate it. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Hi. Good afternoon, Mike and Bob. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is just clearly the -- it seems to be the delta in the changing full year guide is largely concentrated in pharma, both large and small. But given the sort of resilience you've seen in the strength in the chemical and advanced materials space with that 16% growth, what is your kind of outlook on that end market? I mean should we expect a level of durability of demand certainly relative to what you're seeing in pharma over the course of this year, which could help offset some of the growth impact you're seeing in outside? It's a great question. And Bob, I think that's actually what we've assumed in our full year guide.\",)\n",
      "(\"And then Chemical and Advanced Material was like a tale of 2 cities. It looks like C&E was down 15% in the quarter, you said and you talked a lot about PFAS. And so is there any more color like what you're seeing on kind of both sides of coin there? What's kind of baked in on the core chemical and energy side for the year and just anything on trends there? And then obviously, it sounds like you guys still remain really constructive on the Applied Materials side or Advanced Material side. So how about Bob lead here a few comments. And then I've been dying to pull Phil in on here as well. And maybe talk about some of the things he's seen on the Advanced Materials side, which is a real area of expertise for him, so. But I think your word of tail of 2 cities is really quite appropriate, both in terms of breakout by segment, also by geography. I think we posted 70% growth, if I remember correctly, in China last year. So I mean that's a tough comp. I don't care who you are. But we're seeing continued slowness on the C&E side.\",)\n",
      "(\"But I think what we're doing is, I think I got it which is we're actually expanding our portfolio which is we're the leader in siRNA. We've got a broad base of business broad-based set of number of pharma customers. Over time, you hear more about those when their therapeutics come to market. but also we're expanding into the CRISPR area. We've got a small business there right now. We do really well. We just don't have all the capacity we need and that's part of the storyboard what we're doing, what we call Project Endeavor. Yes. And Paul, to build on what Mike was saying is not only are we expanding but I think just as importantly, the market is expanding. And so the Alnylams of the world were the pioneers of this technology or one of the pioneers. But if you look at the number of products that are in the clinic or compounds that are in the clinic, it goes well beyond the 2 customers that you just talked about. Rob, maybe just to add just a twitch color to that.\",)\n",
      "(\"And just maybe to further what Mike is saying, when we think about the components of that business, the fastest-growing component is actually the contracted business, which is that connect rate. And it was in the mid-teens this last quarter and continues to be faster growing than the overall business. And as long as we continue to be able to drive that increased attach rate, we feel very good about that. And that comes with - with that growth comes scale and being able to leverage our team with the work that the digital initiatives that we've had as well. And so as Mike said, don't book, I think it was 32% going forward because there were some variable pay true-ups. But certainly, what you've seen quarter in, quarter out is a nice, steady cadence of margin improvement there. Got it. Thanks guys. Thank you. We'll go next now to Jack Meehan at Nephron Research. Thank you. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Jack. Mike, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about some of the more cyclical areas of the business in the CAM segment.

      "(\"What's the pipeline looking in ASD and uses at risk? Yes. I'll tag team on this. I'll lead and Sam, if you want to add some additional color. But first of all, the announcement from Novartis is no new news. We -- that has always been part of the plan and we actually have contractual agreements relative to how much of the on market demand we get. So that's all well known. But relative to the Novartis is one of the many customers we have in this business and we really have worked hard to build a diversified book of business. And we talk a lot about Novartis great customer. I talk a lot about Anylam because we're allowed to talk about those programs but we have a much broader base book of business. And I think that gives us a lot of confidence as we move forward because we have a number of programs that we're supporting. We know not everyone is going to hit but we know that there's going to be a lot of success rates there as well. And Bob? Yes, let me just add something.\",)\n",
      "(\"Our operating margin increased in the first half of the year and we're doubling down on delivering cost efficiencies and increasing productivity to drive more leveraged earnings growth in the second half. As we've done in the past, we will generate additional cost savings so we can continue to invest in innovative new solutions and support for our customers as we enable future profitable growth. We have an unstoppable One Agilent team that is battle-tested. They consistently execute at extremely high level and are well prepared to deal with any challenges they may face. Bob will provide the details on our outlook for Q3 and the full year, but overall, we remain convinced our strategic focus, customer service and unmatched execution of the Agilent team remain the keys to our continued success. After Bob delivers his comments, I'll be back to provide some closing remarks. And now, Bob, over to you. Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics.\",)\n",
      "(\"At the midpoint, we are expecting growth that resembles what we just delivered in Q4 and assumes no significant budget flush during the end of this calendar year. This is against another difficult comp of 10% growth in Q1 of last year. First quarter 2024 non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.20 and $1.23 as the cost savings fully ramp through the quarter. As Mike indicated, while we are expecting low growth in 2024, we remain optimistic about the future of our markets and our long-term prospects. Our business remains very profitable and healthy, and I know we will come out stronger as a company when market growth returns. And now I will turn the floor back over to Parmeet for your questions. Parmeet? Thanks, Bob. Bo, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now? [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this afternoon to Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. And some helpful comments here. Mike, maybe starting with those book-to-bill comments here. Overall company 1 turn LSAG instrumentation looks like it's turned. Curious what those book-to-bill numbers for ex-China? And if instrumentation has turned, that Q1 guidance, comps get easier.\",)\n",
      "(\"And if you looked at it ex-China, that was largely influenced by China, we grew low single digits in consumables. Okay. And so does that imply instruments may be down over 20% in the quarter? They were down, yes. Okay. Yes. And I guess maybe just a follow up on Derik's question. I think everybody is trying to think about the right way to interpret this book-to-bill commentary, but just is there any additional color you can share on the magnitude were orders down in the quarter? Or I guess, just trying to understand because there was an easy or a difficult comp on revenue like are orders kind of more -- don't have a similar level of volatility. It should have mathematically been over 1, right? Yes. So the orders were down year-on-year, but obviously down not as much as revenue down year-on-year. And so when we look at it, I think that kind of shows though, the stabilization because we had some pretty significant revenue last year because of the recovery in the first thing Shanghai shutdown.\",)\n",
      "(\"So real quick on NASD. But are you guys seeing any pressure from the market, seeing any in-sourcing from the market? I know Novartis has talked about doing some of this as well. And then lastly additionally, with that with the CapEx guide down. Are you guys still investing in additional lines there for the year? Or is that really on pause is that have anything to do with that kind of CapEx stepped down? Let me leave it there. And then have Bob jump-in and Sam as well, but from in-sourcing standpoint. No, we're not seeing any material moves in this direction. And in fact as we head into '24, we continue to broaden our book of business and we're going to have more customers overhead in terms of breadth of customers as we go into '24. And yes, it's called Project Endeavor. So Train B we went live, which we had a different code-named. And that's live, but we continue to move forward with our expansion plans on the other front, siRNA front, along with what we like to do on the CRISPR side as well And antisense. So, we're going to broaden that.\",)\n",
      "('This strong performance was primarily offset by softness in China, which was down year-on-year, but up slightly on a sequential basis. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market declined 4%. While we delivered low double-digit growth in our pathology-related businesses, it was more than offset by continued weakness in genomics. The academia and government market was down low single digits with strength in the Americas driven by government funding offset by weakness in China and Europe. Results were pressured across all geographies in the quarter. As Mike mentioned, China was down 31% year-on-year after growing 44% in Q4 of last year, in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. The rest of Asia was down mid-single digits and both the Americas and Europe declined low single digits in the quarter. Before turning to the rest of the P&L, I’d like to quickly summarize some full year highlights by end market and geography. From an end market perspective, all markets grew low to mid-single digits for the year except for pharma, which was down 2% globally. In addition, all geographies grew, except China which was down 5%. Back to the P&L for the quarter.',)\n",
      "(\"The Agilent team continues to execute well as we navigate our way through ongoing challenges of the current market environment. Our Q3 revenue was $1.67 billion at the top end of our expectations. This is a decline of 2% on a core basis against a tough compare of 13% in Q3 of last year. We continue to be proactive and are taking steps to help us deliver on our leveraged earnings model. Operating margins are 29.3%, up 180 basis points. Quarterly earnings per share of $1.43 are up 7% and above our expectations. The major drive behind our Q3 year-on-year decline in revenue is our China business. Excluding China, the rest of Agilent grew 2%, which was better than expected. We knew we're up against a difficult compare in China and had previously guided for lower China revenues in Q3. However, the economy in China continued to weaken during the quarter, translated into a more challenging market environment than we had anticipated. With the softer market conditions in China and continued global macroeconomic challenges, we have lower growth expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year.\",)\n",
      "(\"Our next question will come from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Maybe just to start out, maybe bigger picture in China. It sounded like you made some comments about sequential improvement. It sounds like it's informing some of your confidence for back half. What are the risks that China just simply doesn't get worse and just kind of bounce along the bottom. And what kind of catalysts are you looking for in China for the back half for some level of improvement? I know it's not necessarily baked in your guide but you did make some comments about some sort of nascent optimism there potentially? Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Matt. And as we had a really, I think, a nice print to start off the year. A big part of that was the performance in China. Yes, we had a bit of a pull-in from Q2 from Lunar New Year but the business overall was better than expected. And to answer your question, we now have several quarters real orders, real revenue and the sequential growth, the numbers are real.\",)\n",
      "(\"First of all, we continue to see the trend of hospitals and health care systems being able to work through COVID and start to reprioritize cancer diagnostics. So overall, I think that's been something that's positive. We've continued to see strength in our IHC solutions, be it our companion diagnostic solutions that are in the market. But more broadly speaking, including for the antibodies that we have, that we sell as ready-to-use reagents. We're also continuing to see good traction for our advanced staining system, the Dakotas. So all of that, you look at that geographically, we've had some good success, particularly in Europe but the Americas as well. Great. And then sticking with DGG, either for you, Sam, or for Mike. Just on the genomics side, I was backing into sort of like a high-teens decline in the quarter, if that sounds right. I'm just curious, different companies have called out different issues in this end market. If you could talk about just maybe what exactly you're seeing, that would be great. Bob, I don't remember the exact number but it was down but not to that extent.\",)\n",

I'm honored to be able to follow you as Agilent's next CEO and I'm grateful for your support throughout my career and during this transition. You have made a significant impact on Agilent, our customers and our team. I'd also like to welcome Angelica Riemann to this call.

We’re confident in the long-term growth prospects for the markets we serve. Before I finish covering DGG, I want to thank Sam Raha for his contributions over the years and for helping us build a strong foundation for the DGG business. I wish Sam well. In addition to these business group highlights, during the quarter we were recognized for our commitment to sustainability. Agilent’s near and long-term targets for reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions have been approved by the highly regarded Science Based Targets initiative. A year ago, we entered 2023 sharing a view of economic and industry uncertainty, as we guided for moderating growth in the second half of 2023. We had not anticipated, however, the significance of the market headwinds the industry eventually faced, particularly in the pharma market and China. Despite the challenging market conditions, we delivered full year revenue of $6.83 billion, growing 1.5% core.',)\n",

      "(\"I think there really isn't anything new to talk about today relative to new news relative to the second half, we still remain -- we still want to acknowledge the uncertainty about the back half of the year. So really no new news here. It's very consistent to what we talked about in November. I think you're going to hear a lot of us talking about normalization of growth rates -- normalization of deal cycle times. So the funnels remain healthy. The deal cycle times are I think we've already more towards historical levels. And Bob, I don't know if you'd add anything to that? No, I think you're right. I mean, I think, obviously, we had a very strong start to the year with double-digit growth from LSAG we will go up against very tough comps in the back half of the year with the recovery of the business. But as Mike said, pleased with the very good start but not anything material change. The next to Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Mike, I think you said China was up 13% in the quarter. That's a lot better than we've heard from some of the other counterparts.\",)\n",
      "('And as Mike mentioned, Chemicals and Advanced Materials also continued to be very strong, growing 14% during the quarter on top of 15% growth last year. The chemical and energy subsegments of the market are doing well while the advanced materials market continues to deliver outsized growth. Semiconductors and batteries are driving demand, helped by government investment in this area. The food market grew 8% during the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in China. The environmental and forensics business grew 12%, led by the Americas as increased testing for PFAS chemicals drives customer investment in this area and recently approved U.S. legislation leads to broad spending in the environmental market. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 4% versus 11% growth last year. Pathology led the way for us here, partially offset by industry-wide challenges in the genomics market. And the academia and government market was up 8%, led by LCs and services. Regionally, Europe and Asia showed strong results. On a geographic basis, the China team delivered 13% growth and Europe grew 10%, both exceeding expectations. The Americas had another solid quarter coming in at 8%, in line with our expectations.',)\n",
      "(\"So we're -- we have obviously nothing to announce but we remain very interested in looking for opportunities that can augment our core organic business and this is at the heart of our build and buy growth strategy. As I've said a number of times, the buy side is all optionality for us. We'll do just fine with all the bets we have right now. But if we see the right thing, we will move on it. And we just have also just wanted to make sure we stuck with our framework and we don't ever want to have buyers remorse. So we've been very happy with all the deals we've done to date and we'll continue to use that framework moving forward. I think that fit piece that you described is really a key criteria for us. Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Maybe one on just the order side. I know you guys talked a little bit about the backlog remaining pretty healthy. Can you just give a little bit of color in terms of what the order growth looked like in the quarter?\",)\n",
      "(\"It's hard to get all the good news in but I think we had a good start to the year at cell analysis, Jacob, as I recall? Yes. We had another good quarter in sale analysis. Actually, we're really proud of what we build up of the business over the past years here in cell analysis in the M&A and the acquisitions we have done. And you're absolutely right that the main opportunities are within the biopharma academia and we've actually done a really good job in diversifying where we had some of the business we acquired was very exposed to academia and we've been able to really penetrate into the biopharma over the past years. So we continue to see opportunities and especially actually in the high end of the business that there's still a lot of opportunities in the biopharma space and especially in understanding the immune system, immuno-oncology, CAR-T and others is areas that we have put a lot of investments into and we see that pays off. So I believe there is still a lot of opportunities in front of us here. There is a strong correlation there in the biopharma academia space.\",)\n",
      "(\"So my question really is what's your position in the market? Do you think you're the dominant vendor? And two, does this number of partners suggest you're going way beyond Novartis and Alnylam? Paul, I'm really glad you hung on and got your question because very enthusiastic to answer that question. We have a much broader base of business beyond 2 very good customers but the programs go much, much, much broader than that. And we are the market leader. Yes. We crossed over on the siRNA piece. We are clearly the market leader. We are going to be going after more aggressively the CRISPR space where we can't yet claim leadership. But overall, we've really -- with the capacity expansion, the continued great work of our team. We continue to gain market share. And from the math we're doing, we've now crossed over in the leader in the space. So in fact, what you're really building out is the kind of market or the technological I guess, threshold we've now achieved. Is that fair to say? I'm not sure I understand completely the question.\",)\n",
      "(\"Got it. Thanks for that. And then if I could ask an academic and government here, smaller segment for you, but it did solid in the quarter. Maybe could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing across the globe in different geographies for academic and government and your expectations here going forward? Thank you. Yes, Bob, I think this is an end market that is holding up reasonably well. I mean we're seeing that on a global basis, in most cases, with the exception being China, where the funding is there, the funding is stable. And it's been a positive surprise for us so far through this year. And I don't... No, it's really across many of our instrument platforms as well as the service business. And from what we're seeing, Puneet, is funding continue to be available, and it's flowing from governments. I think they're seeing the strategic nature of many of the investments that they're making. And our expectation is that, that funding will continue. Got it. Super. Thank you. You're welcome. We'll go next now to Rachel Vatnsdal at JPMorgan. Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the question.\",)\n",
      "(\"I guess, would you assume instruments as a starting point growth in fiscal '24 for what you see today? Based on what we see today, yes. Got it. I mean one more, quick one just on - yes… There's no reason to believe when we think about kind of the level of investment over-time. And the importance of our instruments in the Discovery of new therapeutic areas or food testing, we think about as Mike was talking about these new areas around Applied Markets, there's no reason to think that there is something fundamentally has changed, that they don't need instrumentation. And so, I think we feel very good about our market-share and our good about our market-share, and our competitiveness and do expect our LSAG business to be a growth driver for us going forward. Yes, no completely. No, is this more just on the comp basis, after making… That sounds great. Bob and just one quick one, just on - the applied versus the chemical, you mentioned some chemical weakening just that were concerned during the quarter, but the applied obviously powering through.\",)\n",
      "(\"Your next question comes from the line of Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Mike, curious what year-over-year orders were in LC and mass spec? Were orders there down kind of in the mid-teens range? And then within large pharma, I think you mentioned the funnel remains healthy, but it's just taking longer to close deals. I guess based on conversations with key accounts recently, anything you can point to that gives you confidence that the slower orders here are more reflecting delays in the purchasing process as opposed to just tighter budgets and maybe lapse reprioritize the capital to other instrument categories, maybe outside of LCMS? Yes, I want to tag team with Padraig on this, and then I'll go back to the order question to Bob. But yes, I mean, what we're hearing or I heard directly is customers aren't cutting their budgets. And I happened to be in Europe last month at our demo facility in Vauban, Germany. It's fully booked for the next three months. I mean -- so there's a lot of interest, a lot of interest in Agilent solutions. We just can't get the PEOs through their approval process inside their companies.\",)\n",
      "(\"I wouldn't think it would be very GDP, PMI-tethered and I wouldn't think that Silicon Valley Bank or what have you would be that material for that customer set. Yes. I don't think you can point to Silicon Valley, but you can point to the pressure that the pharma companies run relative to their P&Ls, and they're cautious. They're really cautious about deploying new capital. And it's... Yes. And I would add, Mike, the approval levels that we're seeing are going up and up and at the highest levels within pharma accounts are making decisions on capital purchase. So a lot of caution is around that. Yes. And Dan, I have to say in all transparency, it's a little bit hard to figure out, right, because we had a similar thesis, which was the markets would be more resilient. Although we expect with some level of pressure as we assumed in our second half guide, a little more resilient in the face of slowing GDP. But things have -- obviously, things have moved more quickly than we had anticipated. And this level of increased costs was something we've seen in the last probably four to six weeks.\",)\n",
      "(\"I think there's significant opportunity to drive growth for our business and it's about at 1 point of attach rate is about $30 million annually. And we know our customers have adopted workflow solutions that a tight integration on the instruments. And that allows us, of course, with the 1 commercial organization to demonstrate the value and of course, attach more services and consumables. I will say if you think about what Jacob said about PFAS and biopharma, our focus on solution selling has really paid off. That's really driven attach rates. And I think our overall attach rate in both services and consumers are now in the low 30s and that represents a 2% increase and we expect that to grow as we move forward. And as your question focused on the attach rate on services. But I'd be remiss not to have Jacob talked about what's going on in attach rate to consumers that ties in this workflow solutions because we did make some changes organizationally but the ACG strategy of driving connect rates and services and consumables remains intact. Yes, exactly.\",)\n",
      "(\"So globally, that obviously comes into the onshoring. And globally, we're in strong positions in those markets and have been historically and continue to innovate strongly around those markets and stay close to those customers. We go next now to Dan Leonard at UBS. I wanted to circle back for a moment on the Q1 guide. You spoke about a challenging year-on-year comp a couple of times. But as you're thinking about the Q4 to Q1 sequential ramp in dollars, how much of that decline forecasted is what you chalk up to seasonality versus prudent if you could give us a flavor. Great question, Bob. Yes, Dan, that's a great question. If you look at last year and our revenue went down roughly $90 million; $90 million, $95 million from an extremely strong Q4 to also a very strong -- if you look at the midpoint of the guide, it's a little over $105 million, $110 million. So there is an element of looking at what we did last year, again, not assuming a strong budget.\",)\n",
      "('As Mike stated, we expect to see a slow but steady recovery throughout fiscal 2024. However, we also acknowledge the continued market uncertainty, high interest rates, volatile exchange rates and depressed capital spending. Like several of our peers, we expect the markets to be down slightly for the year, while we expect to perform better. Given the expected slower market conditions, we have taken additional steps to adjust our cost structure. Incorporated into our guidance is roughly $175 million of cost savings. Given the significance, I want to provide a little more detail on these actions. Roughly 30% of the savings are related to portfolio optimization decisions we have taken in DGG, the largest of which was the exit of the Resolution Biosciences business. Another 25% is related to materials and logistics cost savings as well as optimizing our real estate footprint, with the remaining savings tied to continued reductions in discretionary spend and optimizing our workforce. Along with these actions, we have taken a $46 million charge for restructuring and other related costs in our Q4 GAAP results.',)\n",
      "(\"I think the real wildcard for us, we look forward into '24, is really what do we assume around the China market. We're not assuming any kind of major further degradation, but at the same point in time, it's the path to return to kind of historic growth rates. That's the open question right now. Understood. Thanks, guys. We'll go next now to Dan Leonard at Credit Suisse. Hi, Dan. Thank you. Hi, Mike. I wanted to follow-up on that last part. You've seen a lot of cycles in China over 30 plus years. What would you compare this to and how do we get out of it? I am as old as the dirt and have been working in this marketplace since the mid-90s. I haven't seen a cycle like this before. And we've not seen a situation where the - there's really seem to be a lack of confidence right now in the macro economy. Now, look I'm not sharing - anything that the audience here doesn't fully understand already. So, the way we get out of this, I think is China led by the government.\",)\n",
      "(\"Why is Q1 assuming no benefit from this turn in instrumentation? Yes, Vijay. Let me take that. I think if you look at the book-to-bill ratio, it's -- for LSAG instruments, it's actually very similar to both including China and excluding China. China was actually slightly positive as well. So that's a good sign. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're taking a prudent approach to our first quarter. And certainly, we see this as a positive. We did have some -- we typically do have seasonality from our Q4 to Q1, but we're taking it kind of one quarter at a time. Yes, I think part of the big story, too, Vijay, is the 10% comp from last year as well. But as we said it in the call, we were -- it was encouraging to see some initial signs of stabilization with that kind of book-to-bill on the instrument side. Understood. I'm glad to hear prudency and right off the bat here. We got that into the script, Vijay. On -- just one more related on guidance here. What are you assuming for NASD in China for fiscal '24? Yes.\",)\n",
      "(\"I guess coming back to the margin progression in the guidance and just kind of -- I appreciate all the clarity on kind of the cost potential. But also with the second train line kind of ramping and thinking about NAV, I know that you've talked about how those should be accretive -- train line should be accretive to the overall margins. But just as we think about it ramping, can you just give us some context to how to think about that train line coming on and its impact in the back half? Bob, do you want to take that? . Yes, sure. So Liza, if you looked at that in isolation, actually, there is margin compression, given the Train B startup. But we've taken that into account. We had that in our initial guide, and that's money. That's good money to spend because we've got a lot of opportunity there. And so the cost savings that we've been talking about is really not in that area. It's in the other parts of the business. Great.\",)\n",
      "(\"But if you looked at the markets we were down that 9% was roughly down 20%-ish [ph] in pharma. So that continues to be the area of really around the globe but China is no different. The great thing is many of the other markets performed much better. So even when you think about like academia and government, that grew, so did our chem and advanced material business now grew very low single digits. And then our forensics in environmental was down low single digits. So you're actually starting to see the continued stabilization and then you'll get into very much easier compares in the back half of the year in China because that down 22% was down compared to up 12% last year. We had another strong compare in Q2 and then we actually started seeing the pretty significant declines year-on-year. And so there's reasons to be optimistic about that continued stabilization that Mike talked about but we're not ready yet to call an inflection. But when it happens, we'll take it. And Padraig, I know you want to jump in this as well. Yes.\",)\n",
      "(\"And that's why we think it's transitory, although we have to acknowledge what we're seeing today, and that's reflective of the revised guide for the second half. Yes. No. Look, I think you're right, Mike. I think the customer activity remains high. I think one thing that we've really seen is no uptick in cancellations whatsoever. Funnels remain intact. And actually, we're adding fresh funnel in certain cases. So I think it's really a case of slower deal velocity. And on orders, Josh, we won't disclose individual product lines. But as I mentioned, the order growth for LSAG was down mid to high, and they were higher than that. The decline was greater than the average. Okay. And then just a follow-up, I think, on Jack's question. Can you provide more context on what within pharma in China has been softer than expected? Any examples of customers -- any examples that customers have provided on why they're pulling back? And then curious if the softness has been pocketed within a few large accounts there or if it's been fairly systemic? I think there's no real significant difference between some segments of the overall pharma market.\",)\n",
      "(\"I will tell you that even within the quarter, our NGS QC backlog for consumables related to NGS QC, that's actually grown and our orders have grown. So we're doing well there. But there has been a slowness that we're seeing that's broad-based. And to answer your question about share, we don't believe that we're losing share. Similar to what you've heard about the instrument, it's not that we're losing orders at the time in which the orders are being placed. It is just being lengthened. And in U.S. in particular, a little bit in China is where we're seeing the impact. We are assuming a level of improvement in our genomics business in the second half in our guidance I'll recall, Bob, and not full recovery, but improvement. Yes. I would say, Dan, some of our end customers have had a really challenging time and shut down sites, and that has affected our volumes. We saw that in Q1, and it continued into Q2. As Mike, you're saying, we start anniversary-ing some of those in the back half of the year and expect it to perform better. But some of those are customer-specific. Thank you for all the color.\",)\n",
      "(\"There's a lot of collaborations where especially if you look into the CAR-T where you see a lot of the big university hospitals that is investing into this. So it's kind of a crossover between the academia and biopharma right now. So we see opportunities in both those areas right now. Awesome. And then I guess... Just one other comment. Just you had asked about kind of growth rates. What I would say is it grew faster than the overall company faster than LSAG. Awesome. Super helpful. I guess if I could just squeeze in one last one on the attachment rate. You're just crossed over the 30% line. I think I'm more thinking about kind of -- how do we think about kind of the incremental, particularly I'm thinking about services, ACG did pretty well this quarter. The revenue progression as we're looking at a larger installed base that's been put out over the past couple of years? Yes. And I'll have you make some cost or part. But I think we're expecting the continued step-up in that attach rate. Yes.\",)\n",
      "(\"So we're not seeing anything on the macro world that would also dramatically change what has continued to be a very challenging economic market in China. So what gives us confidence is the fact that we've had a number of quarters now, our predictability in the business. The numbers are coming in slightly better than we had anticipated. But again, I think it's more just the fact that there's ongoing run rate of business that gives us confidence on the outlook. And Bob, I know that you want to jump in on this one Padraig? Yes. And I think if, Matt, as you just mentioned, we aren't assuming any inflection in our guide. That's been consistent. Actually, Q1 ended up being a little better than we anticipated. We kind of putting that money in the bank, so to speak. And if you look at it, we'll have now quarters of numbers that are relatively stable which is a very positive sign. And I think when we look at our funnel, it's also stable as well as the order funnel -- order forecast is what Mike just talked about as well.\",)\n",
      "(\"So I don't think that, that -- we actually think that this is the best way to kind of look at it on a go-forward basis because we don't have the play of the backlog happening much anymore. And so actually, as we look at it on a quarterly basis, we've seen a nice, steady progression up back to historical numbers. And Jack, I think it's fair to say, Bob, that one of the things we were conscious was a lot of commentary about how significantly things we're getting in terms of being worse. And as you know, we've been out for some time, calling for no year-end budget flush, constrained capital environment. We came into the year actually guiding for a slower growth in the second half. So what we're trying to intimate in the call today is what we've been saying for the last several quarters is exactly what we're seeing right now. And I thought -- we thought a proof point was the book-to-bill -- listen, it's not great out there in terms of robust growth, but the sky is also not falling either. The next now to Puneet Souda at Leerink Partners. First one on CrossLab.\",)\n",
      "(\"And it's difficult to figure out from the standpoint is there's no obvious external catalyst. We just know we're seeing it across a broad section of our customer base. Appreciate that. And a separate question. Can you comment a bit more on what's going on in the genomics market within your DGG business? Do you think there's any share shift happen? Is it all the pressure is market related? And when would you expect that that could improve? Yes. So I'm going to invite Sam on to this, but I think what you'll hear from him is he'll talk to you about it's a U.S.-centric phenomenon, not a market share issue. And there is that level of CapEx there that's on the instrument side that we're feeling a bit as well. Yes. Absolutely, Mike. And thank you for the question. What we found is that when you think about translational research, we've already talked about pharma here also as it's used in genomics and diagnostic testing too. There's just become a slowness in decision making, not only in instruments, but even in the usage of consumables particularly on the instruments.\",)\n",
      "(\"We also announced we're increasing our dividend by 7%, along with a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization continuing our successful balanced approach to capital deployment. Our balance sheet continues to remain healthy as we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 0.8. Now let's move to our revised outlook for the year and the upcoming quarter. The macroeconomic environment remains dynamic and interest rates and currencies continue to be volatile. However, given the good start to the year, we are increasing our full year revenue to a range of $7.03 billion to $7.10 billion. This increase updates our full year core revenue guidance to a range of 5.5% to 6.5%, increasing the midpoint of our guidance to 6%. We've also seen the dollar weaken against major currencies in the first quarter although it has rebounded somewhat in February. And as a result, the full year guide reflects $100 million of favorable currency movements since our initial guide in November. And for the full year, we still expect currency to be an almost 300 basis point headwind to reported growth.\",)\n",
      "(\"And I actually happen to have Jacob talk about it because I think you've just spent some time in front of the Board recently and talking about the PFAS opportunity. I don't want to educate the Board on what it's all about but the durability of growth we're seeing, we see here. Yes, absolutely. And we continue to see a lot of opportunities in the PFAS where at the beginning was really all about looking for PFAS in the water supply and now it's moving into food and other types of areas. So I think you are right, we are still in the early phases of the growth opportunity. As you know, the U.S. infrastructure build, there was a $4 billion set aside to PFAS testing. And so we have one of the leading solutions here. I mean PFAS is very difficult to measure. So you need high-end instrumentation but also very specified sample prep and consumables to really make sure that you don't contaminate why you measure.\",)\n",
      "(\"As part of this announcement, we are very proud to be the leader in the medical equipment and services industry for our treatment of employees and focus on customer relations. The Agilent team navigated challenging market uncertainties in Q1 and yet once again produced excellent results. It was a great start to the year. Q1 was another outstanding example of the work we've done to build a resilient company with multiple growth drivers. Those growth drivers create through targeted investments that aim to expand and enhance our business in high-growth areas are the heart of our Build and Buy growth strategy. As we look ahead to Q2, we remain confident in the strength and resilience of our business. We have an unstoppable One Agilent team that continues to execute at an extremely high level and is well prepared to deal with any challenges they face. Given the strong start to the year, we are raising our full year core revenue and EPS guidance while also keeping a close eye on macroeconomic conditions. I will provide the detail on our overall outlook but overall, we remain convinced our strategic focus and unmatched execution capabilities will continue to drive strong results.\",)\n",
      "(\"And we hear -- I don't want to get too down my skies on this, but we hear customers talk about some new focused investments. And I think we're not calling for a big broad-based market recovery, but certain segments of the market are going to be better. We're talking about some investments in R&D tools, what's going to PFAS testing capacity expansion plan we're hearing from our customers, Advanced Materials. And then as you mentioned earlier, Patrick, there's an easier compare in second half '24 as well. So we do expect this return to growth. And I think as -- it's not simply a hope. We've got some information to be kind of back up our thinking there. Again, we'll know a lot better about how things look when we get to the budgeting phase of our customers in early 2024. Again, right now, the markets for capital -- instrument still remain quite challenged. And as I mentioned, we are seeing encouraging signs of potential stabilization, but it's going to be a journey for our return into growth. And I think our guide reflects that.\",)\n",
      "(\"And I think what remains to be seen is, I think it's going to be a CEO/CFO decision at our larger pharma companies about how they'll handle their full year budgets. And again, that relates primarily to the instrument side of our business. As we commented in our prepared remarks, consumables and services continued -- demand continued quite strong in these marketplaces. Anything else to add to that? Brandon, this is Bob. Just to kind of frame in, if we think about these businesses, this emerging biotech, which is the one that has really changed during the course of Q2. That represents roughly about 10% of our pharma business, and we were projecting that at roughly low double digits. And now we're expecting that to decline. And as Mike was saying, the rest of the business was high single digits, and now we're assuming kind of low double digits, given this more conservative capital. I would also say the funnels are healthy from the standpoint of working with them. It's just taking longer for them to translate that deal velocity into orders. Bob, one thing I forgot to mention as well is we aren't hearing the budgets are being cut.\",)\n",
      "(\"So this kind of goes back to kind of our historical performance where orders are a little higher, particularly because we have October in our results. And so last year was actually an aberration, so to speak, as we're working down the backlog and this kind of gets back to our normal process. Yes. And through the quarter, Derik, we saw a normal seasonality. So there wasn't anything unusual about the order pattern to kind of say, is this a head fake or not. So I think that also is one of the reasons why we say, okay, early signs of some stabilization here. Again, not huge growth. We're seeing stabilization. We'll go next now to Jack Meehan at Nephron Research. So I wanted to dig a little bit more into LSAG in the quarter. Can you break down the growth between instruments and consumables and just any commentary across product lines. Everything I would say for the quarter was pressured, although consumables performed better than the instrumentation. Our consumables business was down kind of low single digits and against a very tough comp of almost 9%, 10%.\",)\n",
      "(\"So first off, one of your peers have flagged that they were actually seeing some early signs of pharma spending recovery I appreciate that most of the incremental this quarter, is really related to the China weakness. So maybe ex-China, can you walk us through if you're seeing any signs of recovery of spending with biopharma customers. And then you've previously flagged for us that historically, when pharma spending slows down, like we're seeing today that it can take 12 to 24 months to recover. So how are you thinking about the timing, and recovery given the incremental weakness this quarter? Sure, Rachel. So while we saw signs of stabilization in our European and U.S. business stabilization relative to expectations. We're not hearing anything along those lines yet in terms of recovery or desire to increase spending, the fact we're hearing the exact opposite right now from our large major pharma companies. So, I hope that commentary from others in this space is correct. And there's going to be a big recovery here from year-end, but we're not seeing any kind of indications of that. If it does happen, great.\",)\n",
      "(\"But so true to form, Puneet and one of the things -- I'll start with the last one. I mean, we typically do have seasonality. There is that $15 million that gets pushed from one quarter to another; that's strictly timing in China because of the Lunar New Year. But Q2 is typically a lower revenue number. So we're building in that normal seasonality. In terms of book-to-bill in China, actually book-to-bill was greater than 1 in China; so continued stabilization. And in terms of book-to-bill for our instruments, it was below 1, are kind of expected. Now some of that was a result of the China pull forward where the orders came in and we were expecting that revenue to be shipped in Q2; so there's some element of timing there. But all in all, a positive start to the year. Bob, if I cover headline on that, too, I'd just say that Q2 seasonality is as normal and the Q1 book-to-bill results are as our normal pattern. So again, we've been talking a lot about normalization of business flow. And I think we're seeing it in terms of the seasonal patterns and book-to-revenue situations.\",)\n",
      "(\"Can you just maybe unpack a little bit more how you're thinking about like how we exit the year across your different buckets within the chemical and applied segment? Yes. I mean, I think if you look at Q4, it will be really an impact of China. So we're actually looking at chemical and advanced materials declining in Q4, because of that 70% increase that Mike mentioned in Q4 of last year. That was across-the-board. I would say the advanced materials will be much stronger than that down high or down double-digits. And the chemical side, probably we will have a bigger impact. If you recall, the Shanghai shutdown impact was centered in the chemical and advanced materials market, because that's where our GC manufacturing was and that's a Workhorse for some of those products. So, we do see it down in Q4, but up for the full-year. I think that's a really important to make sure that people understand. Great, thank you. Thank you. And we have time for one more question this afternoon, we'll take that now from Luke Sergott at Barclays. Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Hi Luke. Just real quick on the - thanks.\",)\n",
      "(\"Bob, I think I recall correctly, outside of China, our biopharma business actually grew in the quarter. That's right. Your next question comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. So first up, I just want to follow up there on a comments around book-to-bill. So you mentioned the book-to-bill for instrumentation was below 1 for the quarter and some of that was really timing related. So I guess, can you just break that down for us a little bit further. What trends are you seeing in liquid chromatography versus mass spectro for example? And then is there any dynamics or trends to call out from geography on the instrumentation business as well? I don't think there's any new trends here. I think without going into the details of our product line, the small molecule side has really been in an area where we've talked about the year-on-year challenges there from the LC side.\",)\n",

Relative to stimulus, we've been on record and the story remains the same as we've seen no material impact from China stimulus, which, in fact, we understand was closed off at the end of -- in February. And that initial stimulus program from our understanding was really focused on more on the high-end research space, things such as NMRs and SEMs, products where we don't have an offering or compete.

Your next question comes from the line of Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. Yes. Just a couple on my end and maybe Bob, starting with you first, a follow-up on the guide. Can you comment a bit more on how Q2 guide moved versus the framework and the initial outlook? I assume core outlook came down a bit but just wanted to confirm the moving pieces there.

We think the therapeutic oligo market for the suppliers that we are $1 billion today, growing to $2.4 billion by 2027.

Just to give you a little bit more color, we're doing work with over 30 pharma partners today and on dozens of programs at various stages.

We go next now to Puneet Souda of SVB.\",)\n",
      "(\"So maybe just talk about the gives and takes there and confidence in terms of some of the cost outs. Yes, that's a great insight there, Patrick. Yes, because we do have some add backs, I would say that -- so don't take that $175 million and drop it to the bottom line because we have some resets, I would say roughly half of that is kind of a reset between our sales comp and variable pay. If we think about it is really across the P&L, the biggest piece actually is in DGG with the exit of the Res Bio business, but we've also taken some tough decisions in other product lines to streamline the portfolio there. And I would say roughly a little over 30% of that is associated with that. The other 25% is really within our COGS. Our OFS team has done a phenomenal job of really kind of leaning into reducing our costs around logistics and material costs. And then I talked about the site consolidation as well, which will show up and down the P&L.\",)\n",

I imagine it might have been up sequentially with Train B coming online and on the CapEx line. You pushed out $200 million you spend in that. Just roll into '24? There are some projects maybe you decided to defer from the time being - the environment? Yes, it's a great question. So NASD, we continue to be very pleased with that. We had our first revenue in Q3 from Train B, the first of many more revenues to come from that standpoint, and expect it to continue, and we're still on track for the numbers that we've been talking about through 50-plus for the full year. And in terms of the CapEx, some of that will roll forward, but it's not - we're not going to spend that $200 million in '24 as well.\",)\n",
      "(\"Our LC and LC/MS platforms continued their strong performance during the quarter, growing faster than the market at 16%. Demand in the chemicals and advanced materials end market continues to be strong. particularly for materials used in manufacturing semiconductors and batteries. Our Spectra business grew more than 20% in the quarter and we continue to strengthen our base in spectroscopy across multiple end markets. In Q1, we announced an appointment at the Insight200M. This system is used at checkpoints throughout the London Heathrow Airport to officially provide enhanced security and ensure passenger safety. The Asian Crosse group posted revenue of $381 million in Q1. This is up 13% core as the team continues to take advantage of record instrument placements over the past 2 years along with continued growth and attach rates. Across our team's deep knowledge of customer lab operations continues to drive consistently high levels of customer satisfaction. The breadth and diversity of our product offerings is driving record renewals for support contracts. At the same time, our Enterprise Services business continued its strong momentum, driving growth and converting competitive accounts. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenues of $342 million, up 5% core.\",)\n",
      "(\"So maybe you want to share some of the specifics? Yes, Matt. What we've built into the -- if you looked at where we were at the beginning of the year, the largest changes in pharma, where we were at high single digits, and as I mentioned, going to low single digits. Our chemical and advanced materials, we're still assuming a mid- to high single-digit growth for the full year. Certainly front-end loaded given kind of the challenges that we see in terms of the comps with China. But we are seeing -- we are expecting that to be more resilient given some of the fundamental secular drivers of semicon and batteries. So it continues to be strong and are expected to stay strong in the second half of the year as well. Got it. It's really helpful. And then just a second question for you guys, maybe Padraig.\",)\n",
      "(\"So Q2 is relatively intact for what we had originally thought with the exception of that small movement of the China business, that's roughly a point of core growth from Q1 and Q2 switching. What I would say is Q1 also had a beat into it and what we're taking is some of that out of the second half of the year. And so the takeaway is Q2 is spot on from where we expected it to be, absent that kind of shifting the timing shift of China and then the Q2 or the rest of Q1 kind of the beat really helps us in the second half of the year. And then, Mike, can you talk about how visibility in the business as you've covered the last three months? Has there been any improvement in the ability of the funnel to predict near-term sales or still seeing an elongation of kind of opportunity and quoting, flipping to orders. Curious, total company and then also what you're seeing in pharma specifically. Yes. No, I'll have Padraig jump in as well. I think the business remains the same. I don't think it's any better or any worse.\",)\n",
      "(\"Our next question will come from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. This is Jordan [ph] on for Vijay. Maybe one follow-up on the China side. Have you seen any hints of stimulus to start the year? And if we do see a stimulus, do you have any foresight to what implications that will have on Agilent? Both Padraig and I are in the conference and we're shaking our head, no. We've not heard anything about any potential stimulus. And what I can tell you is if it does happen, it's upside to our outlook. Understood. And then maybe one more for me. Can you talk about how pricing has trended in the quarter? And any updates to your expectations for the remainder of the year? Bob, do you want to take that one? Yes. We were pleased with the results. It was between 1% and 2%. So but in line with kind of the seasonality and the mix that we saw, we would expect to see in Q1. So right now, it's on track.\",)\n",
      "(\"So I think it's a very durable business, and I think it's going to continue to be durable over that time frame. Yes. I think durability is the right word to use here, Padraig and Matt. And this is a resilient part of our company's portfolio. We've talked about these recurring revenue businesses. And I think the story here is even bigger, Padraig, than extension of instrument life as people are deferring replacement purchases. We also believe we've been picking up share and particularly been doing really nicely job on the enterprise level. I would also say, Mike, we still have a big opportunity to attach our service contracts onto the business. And of course, as we go through this cycle, we continue to accelerate that. Great. Thanks very much. Your next question comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Okay, thank you for taking the questions. So first, just maybe some questions on backlog. You noted that you worked on your backlog this quarter. So could you just tell us how many months of backlog do you have on that instrument portfolio today?\",)\n",

      "(\"What I would say is if you looked across the moving pieces, with the NASD being slightly lower, that would be offset by a little better results in the LSAG side of the business. And really, that chemical and advanced materials and academia are two areas that are probably slightly better than what we had forecasted. But overall, we're maintaining the guide and as we are looking here felt good about really at the start to the year. Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. So my first question is really around maybe, I think Bob, you talked a little bit about the book-to-bill orders growing faster than revenue. But maybe could you elaborate a bit on more on the instrumentation side, what you're seeing and what you're seeing with the respect to book-to-bill in China? And a quick question, a clarifying question on the 2Q guide. It does look a slight step down versus Q1. And I just want to make sure beyond the Lunar New Year? What else are you baking in there? Yes. I'll take that. There are a lot of questions in that one question.\",)\n",
      "(\"We are on track to have more interest income than what we anticipated at the beginning of the year that $20 million and some of that in the first quarter as well and that's really a result of actually having better-than-expected cash flow in the first quarter and great work by the treasury team. I would say that the savings -- we're on track for the savings targets for the full year. And as I think about the year, it's still very early in the year and this provides us what I would say is more confidence in the guide. And then, maybe just on kind of the book-to-bill. How are you guys thinking about -- I think last quarter, you said the book-to-bill for the year would be above 1 but you'd have quarters kind of in and out on the instrument side which obviously we're seeing this quarter. How are you thinking about just the order trends and the book-to-bill trends on the instrument side as we work our way through the year given what you're seeing today? Yes, no change to what we said back in November. Q1 is a proof point for what we said.\",)\n",
      "(\"We have seen some, I would say, some pausing of certain customers as associated with IRA but we think that, that's transitory. So as Mike said, we're not at all concerned about the long-term growth prospects of this market. And in fact, many of the programs that we're seeing come into our portfolio are actually as what we had talked about in previous calls, much larger targeted patient populations, which really speaks well to the volume. And then as Mike mentioned, we're actually expanding our portfolio, our technologies. And so it's not just siRNA, but we're having the ability to continue to grow our CRISPR -- GMP grade CRISPR business as well as antisense. So we're continuing to do that as well. Sam, I know this will be your last call, would have thought it might be interesting for you to jump in here for a second. As part of your transition, you've been talking to a lot of our key customers. And I think we're hearing the same story from them about long-term growth continued investment here. Yes. Absolutely, Mike. I'll just add a couple of things to your and Bob's comments.\",)\n",
      "(\"But I think the storyboard here for LC is very consistent with the overall macro environment we described, which is an increasingly cautious set of decisions being made by customers relative to new instrument purchases. And as you know, we've been talking for some quarters about the moderation we were expecting to see in small molecule LC placements, that the 20-plus growth rates that the industry have been seeing for a number of quarters, would actually see a level of moderation start to occur. And that's what we saw in this recent quarter, and we would expect to see that continue throughout this year. And perhaps, you want to add some of your thoughts here as well, Jacob, and then take on the question about market share as well. Yes, absolutely, and thanks for the question. I mean, first of all, we continue to see good market share gain in the LC business. And we see that, as Mike was mentioning also, over the last year, we have really seen a high growth in the LC business over many of our end markets. Obviously, being fueled significantly in the pharma, both small and large molecules.\",)\n",
      "(\"So first one, Bob, I don't know if I heard it on the call, contribution sort of from pricing in the quarter and for the full year. If I'm correct, you are still expecting 3% pricing contribution this year and that would imply a 3% volume contribution which it appears below historical levels for what Agilent has grown. So just maybe just -- we're trying to understand, given the tailwinds you're seeing in China, NASD and the other areas and obviously, congrats on the strong growth in the quarter. So is there anything you're seeing beyond sort of tougher compares that are emerging in the sort of the second half? No, it's a great question. So I did make a quick reference in the prepared remarks. Actually, Q1 was higher than the overall 3% as expected. We are still planning and forecasting that 3% price contribution for the full year of FY '23. And you're right, that would speak to roughly a 3-point volume. What I would say is we're taking it 1 quarter at a time. As we've said, we're dealing with -- looking forward, there's still some uncertainties around macro.\",)\n",
      "('Despite the revenue declines, our team continues to execute at a very high level. Fourth quarter gross margin was 55.8%, and our operating margin was a healthy 27.8% in Q4, which was slightly better than our internal expectations. Below the line, we benefitted from stronger than expected cash flow generating incremental interest income in the quarter. Our tax rate was 13.75% and we had 293 million diluted shares outstanding, both as expected. Putting it all together, earnings per share were $1.38 for the quarter, exceeding our expectations, albeit down 10% from a year ago when EPS grew 26%. As Mike mentioned, our Q4 results capped a year where we grew 1.5% core on the topline, increased operating margins by 30 basis points and grew EPS by 4%, while overcoming a couple of points of currency headwinds. This is a real statement on the team’s ability to quickly adapt to market changes while still delivering leveraged earnings growth. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, I’m incredibly proud of the Agilent team as Q4 continued a string of very strong quarterly cash flow results.',)\n",
      "(\"Thank you for joining us today. And now, Bob, over to you. Thanks, Mike and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our updated full year guidance and initial guidance for the second quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. We are extremely pleased with our Q1 performance. It was a very solid start to the year. Q1 revenue was $1.76 billion, exceeding our expectations. Revenues were up 10% core and 5% on a reported basis. Currency was a 5-point headwind which was an improvement from the beginning of the quarter, while the M&A contribution was as we expected. Pricing for the quarter was higher than the full year forecast also as we expected. Now I'd like to share some additional detail on our end markets. Results in our largest market, pharma were again very strong. Pharma grew 11% following 17% growth of last year. Performance was solid across both small and large molecules. Small molecule grew 12%, while large molecule grew 9%.\",)\n",
      "(\"As we've talked about, our consumables business and ACG business have the greatest price realization followed by generally speaking, actually, we had a very good result in diagnostics and genomics in the quarter. And then we did see some mix but not anything out of the ordinary instrumentation side. So all in, we're on track for what we expected for the full year. Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Bob, maybe one for you first. Just in terms of the EPS guide. It looks like you guys got an additional $20 million on the kind of net interest other income. Can you just kind of flag if that's rolling through, did that core earnings number move a little lower? Is any moving pieces there? And then secondarily, just on the margin piece, you guys have that cost savings plan. Can you just talk about how that paces as the year goes, would be helpful. Yes. Thanks, Patrick. Great question. And what I would say is a couple of things.\",)\n",
      "(\"While current market conditions remain challenging, the long-term promise of growth remains with end markets power buying investments to improve the human condition.

His track record of success during his Agilent leadership journey speaks for itself and have no doubt, it will continue in his new role.

Regina, if you could please provide instructions for Q&A now.\",)\n",
      "(\"It gives Bob and I that level of predictability around revenue from that backlog. Yes. I would say, as Mike said, I mean, the backlog continues to be healthy and we haven't seen anyone back out of any cancellations or anything like that, that would be beyond kind of the normal activity. But I would emphasize one point I made earlier, the deal cycles are reverting towards the historic norms in this space. Again, this whole construct that we see of a normalization of particularly the analytical instrumentation marketplace evolving. Yes, that's helpful. I appreciate that. And maybe just on kind of the environmental spend, PFAS testing. You've called out the last couple of quarters, Mike, I know you're excited to see some actual infrastructure dollars coming through in the U.S. here. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there, kind of where we are? I mean, it seems really early but just your perspective on kind of how that's tracking, what impact you guys are seeing from that and obviously, the durability as well. Sure. Happy to talk about that.\",)\n",
      "(\"No, if you looked at the sequential number, it's going to be roughly the same as what we had in Q1. And Mike, congrats on your retirement. I was wondering if you could elaborate on timing. I was surprised, others were surprised. I've gotten the question a number of times and we would just love to hear your thoughts. Yes. Thanks for that. So while it's maybe a surprise to many on the call and it was a surprise when I shared the news across the company because the Agilent team just knows how much I love working for this company and work with them. And it really was a hard-wall, really difficult decision for me but not been contemplating this for a while. And I pulled the Board into the discussion sort of communicating with them because we really wanted to make sure that they had enough time to really run a thorough and thoughtful selection process in which they were able to do. And in my mind, they came out with the best possible choice in selecting Padraig.\",)\n",
      "('Now let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. I continue to be pleased with our cash flow generation this year. Cash flow from operations was $562 million in the quarter, and is $1.3 billion year-to-date. In Q3, we invested $81 million in capital expenditures, totaling $214 million year-to-date, effectively flat year-on-year as we continue to optimize our CapEx spending. Given the strong year-to-date results, we are increasing our free cash flow forecast for the year to $1.2 billion, comprised of operating cash flow of $1.5 billion and CapEx of $300 million. This is an increase of $250 million from the midpoint of our previous guidance. Despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions, our balanced capital allocation strategy is intact. During the quarter, we returned $401 million to shareholders. $66 million through dividends and repurchase shares worth $335 million. This ongoing balanced approach to capital deployment is another example of the confidence we have in our team and our belief in the long-term strength of our markets. Before getting into the revised full year outlook, I want to mention we have taken a $291 million pretax charge in Q3 associated with the decision to shut down the Resolution Bioscience business.',)\n",
      "(\"But Phil, I don't know if you want to jump in with any thoughts here but I don't think there's any real outstanding new trends here with perhaps the better-than-expected trends we saw in applied markets, particularly on advanced materials but maybe you have something else you want to add? Yes, sure, Mike. I think that's pretty much the case similar to Q1 around how the markets are performing. We're seeing some bright spots around some of the secular areas in the applied markets, in the instrumentation which is driving the business forward but just support your comments there. Rachel, just one other thing to build on what Mike and Phil were just talking about. When we look at our LSAG business, it was down 11% which was better than what we expected. The piece that's really been driving that down is the pharma market which is what we've been expecting. If we looked at the rest of the markets, they were much better than the down 11% with the exception of the diagnostics and clinical which is a small number. Right. And to your question, Rachel, that dynamic in the pharma really speaks to pressure on the LC business.\",)\n",
